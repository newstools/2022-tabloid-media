Released on a warning due to ill health, a 35-year-old rapist who has been on the run for a 2014 rape at Cato Crest in Mayville, is wanted by police after he failed to appear in court on 28 January 2021. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said: “The Brighton Beach Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit are appealing to members of the community for assistance in locating a wanted suspect Senzo Landlord Mbeje, 35. Mbeje was arrested for raping a 27-year-old woman in 2014 at Cato Crest in Mayville.” It is alleged that on 6 September 2014 at 4.15am, the victim was on her way home when she came across three armed suspects. “At knifepoint, they demanded money and cellphones. When she told them she had nothing, the suspects became irritated and threatened to harm her. One suspect pushed her down on the road and raped her, while the other two were keeping a look-out,” said Col Mbele. A case of rape was opened at the Mayville Police Station and the docket was transferred to the Brighton Beach Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. “The suspect was arrested, appeared in Durban Magistrate’s Court but was released on warning due to ill health. The case was adjourned to 28 January 2021, however, he failed to appear at court. He has been on the run and a warrant for his arrest has been issued by the court,” Col Mbele added. Police are appealing to anyone with information regarding Mbeje’s whereabouts to contact the investigating officer, Detective Constable Bouvrie, on 081-046-3162 or 081-418-1264 or call Crime Stop on 08600-10111.
