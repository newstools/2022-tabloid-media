A second accused in a fraud matter where two men were wanted for fraudulent activity amounting to R1.5 million, was arrested by Chatsworth Police on Friday, 11 February, in Bellair. According to Communications Officer of the Chatsworth SAPS, Captain Cheryl Pillay, the long arm of the law finally caught up with the fraudsters. “On 3 February, Chatsworth Detectives arrested the first accused, Ismail Cassimjee, 51, who had been on the run from police since 2019 after he was sought in fraud cases in the policing precincts of Chatsworth, Greenwood Park and Brighton Beach. The investigating officer from Chatsworth investigated five cases which totalled fraudulent activity amounting to over R1.5 million. After this arrest, investigators from Brighton Beach and Greenwood Park are continuing with investigations linking the fraudster to other cases,” said Capt Pillay. On Monday, 7 February, the investigating officer successfully opposed bail at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court citing that the accused was a flight risk. Cassimjee, who has been remanded into police custody will reappear at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on 14 February for a formal bail application. His 58-year-old co-accused will appear together with him for his first appearance. Acting Station Commander of the Chatsworth SAPS, Colonel PM Moodley, commended the investigating officer who worked relentlessly to ensure that the accused was arrested and placed before the criminal justice system. “Police are appealing to witnesses to follow through with cases to ensure that criminal elements are removed from society,” said Col Moodley.
