Disaster Management teams in partnership with organs of state such as SASSA, Department of Social Development, and non-governmental organisations continue to provide immediate relief to the 138 people that were left homeless when their homes in eMadlangeni and Kokstad local municipalities were flooded on Friday, 4 February.  On Friday morning, Disaster Management teams responded to incidents in wards 1, 2, 3 and 5 in the eMadlangeni Local Municipality where 16 people had to be evacuated as a result of flooding. The torrential rains experienced by the municipality led to the collapse of a local bridge that is on a road leading to the town of Utrecht.  In the greater Kokstad Municipality, a local river burst its banks and flooded surrounding homes in wards 1, 5, and 9. As a result of this, 122 people were left homeless.  Incidents were reported in Mfolozi where a house collapsed in Qard 2 at Cici and in Mtubatuba, Ward 1, where two families were evacuated due to flooding. Disaster Management teams are continuing with assessments that will provide a full picture of the extent of the damage experienced by municipalities. So far there has been no report of any loss of life as a result of these incidents.  Residents are urged to exercise extreme caution and to follow weather reports so that they stay updated on the conditions in their area.
