Netcare 911 spokesperson, Shawn Herbst, said paramedics responded to a collision when a light motor vehicle lost control the previous night. “Reports indicate that the driver of a light motor vehicle lost control some time during the night, resulting in the vehicle rolling down an embankment. A passer-by heard calls for help coming from the bush, went to investigate and found the patient trapped in the car. When medics arrived on the scene they found that the patient had sustained moderate injuries. While medics stabilised the patient, a Netcare 911 rescue technician used hydraulic tools to free the man from the wreckage,” said Herbst. Herbst said that once treated, the patient was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital for further care.
