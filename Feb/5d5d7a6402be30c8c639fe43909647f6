Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all codes of sport had come to a standstill, however, now that lockdown regulations have been eased, contact and non-contact sport can resume. Seizing the opportunity to return to the pitch, Vivian Pillay, plans to start grassroots development for soccer at Satripark Secondary School on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings. Having played and coached senior and junior players over the years, Pillay has a vast knowledge of football that he wants to share with others who have a love for the game. According to Pillay, competitive sport allows children to experience the joy of winning as well as the disappointment of losing, which prepares them for what they encounter later in life. “Like the rest of us, children have a competitive edge but their competitions should be healthy and fun, not a matter of life or death. Participation in a variety of sports aids the all-round development and conditioning of the young athlete,” he said. Pillay plans to open a sports academy for young boys and girls so that they can keep fit and develop sporting skills in cricket, soccer, netball, volley ball, swimming and self-defence.
