I’m always happy, even though he gets on my last nerve. To me I feel if you find a best friend, soul mate and life partner all in a person, you’ve found your home,” added René. Ananta laughed as he said he knew that he was “in trouble after getting a glimpse of René’s smile”. “I’ve found my happiness in her. The thing that stood out for me is how warm and kind she is, and her beautiful smile that lights up the room soon as she walks in,” said Ananta. Destined for a bigger and brighter future full of romance and happiness, the couple said a lot of work goes into to making a relationship strong and long lasting. “Our advice to others is always communicate, there has to be a listener and a speaker in a relationship, for it to work.
