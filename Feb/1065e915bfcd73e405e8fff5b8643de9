The mother of the two children who died in a Welbedacht shooting last week, succumbed to her injuries in hospital on Monday morning, not knowing that her two children were buried on Saturday.  Welbedacht East resident, Charlene Naicker, 38, together with her two children, Chazlyn and Ainzlee, were shot multiple times by three gunmen at the entrance of their home in Pond Street, Welbedacht. The late Naicker was the sister of Democratic Alliance Ward Councillor, Samantha Windvogel. Emotions ran high for the community and family at the funeral of Chazlyn, two, and Ainzlee, 14, Naicker who were killed during a shooting in Welbedacht. The community and family were dressed in white t-shirts with pictures of the late children. The family of Naicker, who has been in a critical condition at an intensive care unit of a local hospital since the incident occurred, had hopes of her recovering to be there for the four of her remaining children and her husband. Councillor Samantha Windvogel said that words cannot describe the way she feels after losing her sister, niece and nephew. “I had high hopes of my sister recovering. It has been a sad affair for our family who had to bury my young niece and nephew on Saturday. The passing away of my sister is an ordeal that I think I would never recover from. I have to be strong as I have to hold everything together and prepare another funeral. I have to be there for my nieces and nephews. I pray that justice prevails for this heinous crime. We lost innocent members of our family and the case should be taken seriously,” she said. Chatsworth SAPS is investigating a case of murder. Investigations are continuing.
