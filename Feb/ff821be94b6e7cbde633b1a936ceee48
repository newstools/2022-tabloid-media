Following Cabinet’s decision to move the country to alert level 1, the Management of the SAPS has taken a decision to resume the organisation’s intake. Police spokesperson, Colonel Athlenda Mathe, said: “The training which had been scheduled to commence in March 2020 was suspended following a declaration of a National State of Disaster and nationwide lockdown by the President of the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The recruitment process had already reached an advanced stage with recruits having undergone various stages in the recruitment and selection process and were only awaiting the final stage where they were to be subjected to a medical assessment. “The basic training of new recruits involves extensive physical contact and with the challenges experienced with the Covid-19 restrictions that were in place, this made it impossible for training to commence. With the recommencement of the recruitment process currently underway, applicants who underwent all stages and were only awaiting the medical assessment will receive an automated short message service (SMS) from the respective SAPS provincial recruitment offices requesting them to report at a particular venue where their fingerprints will be processed to determine their criminal status or previous convictions.” Applicants will also be expected to bring along the following original documents together with three copies of each item: · ID · Driver’s Licence (if applicable/not a necessity) · National Senior Certificate · NQF 6 qualification (if applicable/for stream 2 applicants) For more information, applicants are advised to contact their nearest recruitment offices where they had submitted their initial application. “It should be noted and emphasised that this information is only directed to the applicants who applied during the said period and were subjected to all recruitment and selection processes and were only waiting to be subjected to a medical assessment. “The South African Police Service has also noted with concern several hoax messages containing bogus job listing advertisements circulating on social media and other channels. The SAPS urges potential employment seekers to be wary of these fake job listing advertisements and not fall prey to any scam of this nature,” Col Mathe said. The Department has not advertised any posts for entry level police trainees currently and the public is encouraged to visit the SAPS website at www.saps.gov.za/careers and the Public Service Vacancy Circular (PSVC) for posts that are advertised.
