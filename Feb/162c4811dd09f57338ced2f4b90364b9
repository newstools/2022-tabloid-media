Talks of a new “beer garden” being opened on 64 Helen Joseph, a few blocks below the other restaurants and right in front of a residential block, is giving residents nightmares. Louise Stehouwer, whose house is separated by a boundary wall behind 64 Helen Joseph, said she started noticing renovations being done to the property in November, last year. She went around to ask the people doing the renovations what was coming up there and they allegedly informed her that it was going to be a beer garden. She said: “In December, I was away on holiday and when I came back, I saw that they had started putting up an awning right against my electrical fence, bending the poles, causing my electricity to trip. They even cut the branches of my tree without my consent. I can already feel that I will have sleepless nights.” Stehouwer said a few weeks later, in January, she noticed that two other buildings below 64 Helen Joseph were also being renovated and that they have a ‘To Let’ sign outside. “The one at the far end has been painted the same colour as 64 Helen Joseph, which may mean it was bought by the same business owner,” Stehouwer added. Heather Rorick, Chairperson of Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum who is also living two blocks away from 64 Helen Joseph, said she feels that the residents of Ward 33 are not considered part of the community. “In fact, I feel that businesses and money matter most, more than the residents in this area who bought homes here and have been living here for many years, hoping to retire here. “No notice has been given to the residents, no advert of a proposal has been advertised for public input and yet these clubs keep coming up. It would be understandable that the businesses are normal restaurants or coffee shops which open in the morning, operate during the day and close by 9pm, latest. These so-called restaurants or pubs open till very late, they are issued licences permitting them to open till 2am. How are the residents supposed sleep?” questioned Rorick. She said the second bone of contention is that the establishment is on the bus route and with all the cars which will be coming to this ‘beer garden’, there will be traffic jams. “Already this road is very busy, and 64 Helen Joseph has no parking space. The patrons will have to park across from Davenport Centre where the delivery motorbikes park, all the way down to the corner. Clark Grove, which is not even big enough for two cars to pass, will be the only spot available for parking and the residents of Clark Road will not be able to access their homes. “I really feel that 64 Helen Joseph is not the right place for a beer garden. I feel that the City is allowing all the people who are moving away from the busy Florida Road spots to come here and cause commotion in our community,” Rorick voiced out. She added that the police and Metro are already overwhelmed by the patrons of the other clubs on the upper side of Helen Joseph. Rorick said she has made several attempts to speak to the new owner of property, however, all have failed. “I have had to go through the Rawsons letting agent, Sheldon Johnsen, who informed me that he was just assisting with the sale. I contacted the previous owner, Mr Essa, who also told me that the property no longer belongs to him. Individually, the residents have sent letters to the KZN Liquor Board, questioning the processes of them granting a licence to the business without asking for the public’s input. Our letters were acknowledged, however, they asked us to get the business-owner’s details, of which we cannot find,” Rorick said. The Glenwood Weekly Gazette contacted the previous property owner for comments, however, he said he was not able to comment at this point in time. The Ward 33 Councillor, Sakhile Mngadi, was also contacted to comment on the concerns raised by the residents. He said: “No official communication has been made with me by the Municipality or the business-owner on the matter.” Cllr Mngadi said he also heard the rumour that a Cubana will be opening, however, cannot give an official comment on that. He said as for the public’s input, a notice should be put up if the business will require a liquor licence. “This will give the residents an opportunity to object to that, however, the residents should be aware that the premises is zoned for business use, so that is not a contravention. The process of getting a liquor licence will allow time to send objections, if that hasn’t happened, then there is no active application for the site,” he added. The KZN Liqour Board was also contacted to check whether there was an active application. Penelope Cele of the Liquor Board said: “Our systems are unable to check or trace an application by address, we need a reference number and the name of the outlet.” The Glenwood Weekly Gazette was unable to get hold of the new owner of 64 Helen Joseph Road. Comments from eThekwini Municipality were requested regarding the processes of notifying the residents on new establishments in their area, however, none were received at the time of going to press.
