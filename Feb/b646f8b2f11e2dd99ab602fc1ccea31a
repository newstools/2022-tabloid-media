UMlazi Police officers visited Ezimbuzini Herbal Market to raise awareness and educate the residents about sex-related crime recently. The Ezimbuzini Herbal Market community received educational brochures consisting of protective recommendations and relevant contact details to report sexual offence cases. The team believes this visit will increase participation from residents considering the option to report crime anonymously on the Crime Stop Hotline (080-001-0111). Acting Station Commander of uMlazi SAPS, Colonel JS Nkomo, said: “I urge all men to stand against sexual abuse. Men are created to protect women and children. This role is a significant one in our society today. I also want to encourage the community to take the necessary precautions to ensure they are safe.”
