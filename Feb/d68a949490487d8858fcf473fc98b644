The weekend saw an increase in snake activity in the area as temperatures soar in Durban and surrounds. Nick Evans, the snake catcher, said he received numerous calls for Cobras which were on the move. He said: “I received multiple calls, either to remove a snake or for advice regarding a snake that’s spat in a dog’s eye. Between my friends and I we caught a good few Cobras. These snakes have been cruising around, looking for food, which is mostly toads, although other snakes are on the menu too, so are rats.” Evans said catching Mambas was better than catching Cobras as they do not spit. “One has to admire this brilliant method of self-defence. It’s so effective. Should you see one, just move away from it slowly. If you are more than four metres away, preferably a bit more to be extra safe, you’ll be fine,” said Evans. He said the public should contact him for advice or for snake removals or any venomous snake bites on dogs on 072-809-5806.
