According to legend, the date of Valentine’s execution was 14 February in the year 270 AD, and before he was beheaded, he cured a girl’s blindness and his final act was to write a love letter to her, signed ‘Your Valentine’. Fast forward centuries later, and it’s all about chocolates, hearts and expressing love. One such couple who will be expressing their love for each other this year are young lovers, Amy Young and Cliff Reineke. The pair met through a mutual friend at a surprise braai, bonded over a bowl of cheese and chives dip and have been inseparable ever since. “We were definitely attracted to one another but I wouldn’t say that it was love at first sight as we bumped into each other a few times before we decided to meet alone,” said Young. She said that even though they have been together for a while, she still remembers their first Valentine’s Day together. “Cliff booked us a romantic table at Tramonto for dinner, champagne and the works. I still remember my exact outfit,” she said. According to her, there is also no secret to love. “Love is constant hard work, commitment and communication, and it’s also a lot of smiles, laughs and farts in bed,” she laughed. The pair celebrated Valentine’s Day a week early at a lovely little spot in Glenco called Garage Café. Amy, Cliff and management and staff of Newcastle Express would like to wish our advertisers and readers a happy month of love.
