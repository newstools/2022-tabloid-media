Three great music acts will be sharing the bill on Saturday, 12 February, from 6pm at Musketeers at the German Club as part of the “Welcome to the New” tour with Parable Fifteen, performing with special guests Inter-Alia, and opening act, singer songwriter Zazz. Durban-based four-man country-rock outfit, Parable Fifteen, will be performing their hits You and Me and Firefly which reached number three and number five on the Mixfm justplaindrive SA Top 40; as well as their new single Telling Your Heart which has also been steadily climbing the charts. They are Marc Skarda (vocals), Nic Leahy (guitar), Bryce Breeds (bass guitar) and Marius Botha (drums). Special Guests are husband and wife team, Jane and Paul Candow, who have been professional performers since 1984, playing the Durban music circuit from 1984 until 1997. They were also responsible for some great cabaret and supper-theatre shows post-1997, as well as a slew of TV and corporate performances. Jane’s distinctive voice handles Stevie Nicks, Toto, Pink and Alison Moyet covers with ease. Zazz is a quirky and sassy Durban-based singer songwriter whose work is inspired by contemporary country. Her personality and vocal range commands the stage and her new single, Badass, was released in November 2021. “To me singing is therapy, it makes life pause for a moment and gives me a moment to breathe and focus on the love of music, the love of singing, the love of performing and the gratitude of this life that I get to live,” she said.
