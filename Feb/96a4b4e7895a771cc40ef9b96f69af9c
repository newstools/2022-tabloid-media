The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has strongly condemned the violent demonstration and destruction of property which occurred at its Westville Campus on Friday when a group of about 50 individuals stormed Gate 2 on Varsity Drive which later led to a confrontation between the group and security personnel.  UKZN’s Executive Director for Corporate Relations, Normah Zondo, said security officers who tried to prevent the group from entering Campus were unlawfully pelted with stones by the group. “With the help of private security, Risk Management Services (RMS) personnel later managed to bring the situation under control. The guardhouse and a car belonging to the University appointed security company were damaged during the incident. No injuries have been reported to the University. Members of the South African Police Service and RMS were on campus to monitor the situation and ensure that safety and security is maintained,” said Zondo. She added that the university strongly condemns any violent demonstration and all destruction of property. “The University also wishes to reiterate that no individuals will be allowed on Campus without the requisite University access permit. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is doing everything in its power to protect legitimate students, staff and University property,” she said. Zondo added that the registration process continues online and was not affected by the incident as it is taking place from remote locations.
