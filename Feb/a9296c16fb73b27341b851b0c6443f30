Anderson’s journey of hosting regular scrabble dates, that proved to be a hit with the ladies from the community and beyond, all started while listening to a talk on the negative impact of isolation on a person’s IQ. It was with the intention of beating the lockdown blues, in a way that gives the mind a light workout, that spurred her to initiate the meet-ups. “I thought that since there was tremendous ease of lockdown restrictions why not invite two or three ladies over for something stimulating in a fun, easy going sort of way. We would spend some time sipping on tea or coffee, eat some cake and play some scrabble. It was a very non-threatening environment. “For the first one I invited some of my personal friends, just to see how it goes, and they loved it. So I put the word out on our Durban North groups in March last year and got incredible responses,” said Anderson. The scrabble dates in no time grew into a regular afternoon meet-up among the 30 incredible ladies from all walks of life. While the groups of players consist of four different players at a meet-up, the mingling and sharing of pictures on the group chat after each game have developed into a bond cemented by a safe space where each of them could just be. “We are not a club, it was more of a way to gently draw people out of the lockdown, socialise and stimulate our brains. Some of the ladies were feeling totally isolated. I personally felt that my brain was stagnating because of a lack of regular stimulating, social interactions. Our oldest member is 82 years old and her husband has Alzheimer’s but in the afternoons he is asleep. So she drives up the road for an afternoon game and she goes home feeling as if she has had an outing and that was the primary intention, to just have something simple and welcoming. For her to come out and put everything aside for a bit and to chat with some younger women, it’s really therapeutic.” Anderson said that all of the women are really receptive of one another and that there is always something being learnt, especially between the older and younger generations. “The way we work is that we don’t have separate groups. Whoever wants to come for that particular game can book their spot, so many times there would be games between women from vastly different age groups. They have all felt welcomed, relaxed and they all felt that by the time they left it was a good few hours well spent. The younger ladies are so respectful and the older ladies just love having a conversation with the younger ones. We all learn and we all have something to offer to each other. “People always come back because they find it to be very accepting,” said Anderson, who remains extremely proud of all the wonderful friendships that were formed.
