Another successful grocery donation was completed by the PT Alarms team in the scorching heat on Tuesday, with several families and non-profit organisations grateful for the gesture of goodwill in the Merebank and Chatsworth areas. The PT Alarms crew reached out to members of the community and NGOs in a monthly bid to spread cheer to those who are experiencing challenges in life and need a helping hand. At the end of the day, there were miles of smiles and grateful hearts upon receiving the generous grocery hampers packed with essentials and goodies. PT Alarms spokesperson, Dhevan Govindasamy, said: “The need to uplift the community is the fervent wish of our PT Alarms boss, Mr Strini Govender, who unceasingly strives to offer a lifeline and hope to struggling members of the community and organisations that faithfully care for the physically challenged, frail and abused in society. To be able to enrich one life or more is a victory in itself and PT Alarms is determined to touch as many lives as possible.”<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68599" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696,h_522/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_533/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-150x113.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-696x522.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1392/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1392x1044.jpg 1392w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1068/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_560/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-560x420.jpg 560w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1120/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-1120x840.jpg 1120w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_80/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_160/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-160x120.jpg 160w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_265/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2-265x198.jpg 265w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wentworth-delivery-2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" />
