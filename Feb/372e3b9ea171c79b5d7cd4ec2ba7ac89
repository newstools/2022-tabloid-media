Denise and Preshan Ramjanek together with their beautiful daughters, Hadassah, 6 and Hannah, 2 will be enjoying a candle light dinner on Valentines Day. The Amanzimtoti couple said that they look forward to spoiling their daughters on this special day. Denise and Preshan have been married for the past eight years. Denise said that before having children, their day used to be more romantic with time alone. They would plan date nights and spend lots of time together. “This year, we made it a Family Valentine’s Day. A day that the four of us could spend quality time together. Valentine’s Day for me is a day that should be spent with loved ones. However it should not just be celebrated on this day because it was set aside, but we should love and celebrate the existence of our loved ones everyday,” she said.   She encourages parents to make the day fun and exciting for children by having activities together like picnics, arts, crafts and even spending the day on the beach.
