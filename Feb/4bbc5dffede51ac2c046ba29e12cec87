This follows the Sharks Board decision to remove shark nets as a precaution measure to prevent unnecessary damage. Sharks Board’s Acting head of operations, Greg Thompson, said that the decision was prompted by tropical cyclone Batsirai expected to hit southern Mozambique. “This forecast could affect our local sea and weather conditions from Sunday. We are also, in association with several weather forecasting services, observing the development of two other severe weather advisories which are forecast to affect our local weather patterns at more or less the same time as the cyclone. A large mass of rainfall stretching from Namibia across the Northern Cape and into the Eastern Cape is fast approaching the KZN coastline, and a cold front developing in the Atlantic Ocean and approaching the Western Cape is predicted to reach us early next week,”  said Thompson. “The public is hereby notified that all beaches in eThekwini, from north to south, are closed as a result of the shark nets being removed by the Sharks Board. This closure takes effect immediately and there will be no bathing allowed. The Sharks Board have removed all the shark nets to prevent unnecessary losses and/or damage to their equipment as result of strong winds and heavy seas associated with predicted severe systems,” eThekwini Communications Unit.
