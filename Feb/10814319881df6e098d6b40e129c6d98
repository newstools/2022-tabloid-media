The bullet-riddled bodies of two men were discovered in a sugarcane plantation while the vehicle they were travelling in was found pumped with bullets off the roadway in Inanda, following a drive-by shooting on Saturday. A motorist contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) at approximately 3.59pm after he noticed the occupants of a white BMW opening fire on a white Toyota Avanza with high calibre rifles. RUSA boss, Prem Balram, said: “The caller informed the controller on duty that the Toyota Avanza was travelling from Inanda in the direction of Verulam when the BMW overtook and opened fire. He went on to explain that the Toyota Avanza veered off the road and into a sugarcane plantation. He could not confirm if the occupants were injured and continued driving as he was concerned for his safety.” Balram said reaction officers and RUSA medics were immediately dispatched to the location provided. “On arrival, reaction officers met with officials from Metro Police. The first responders entered the cane field and located the Toyota Avanza approximately 50 metres from the road. The vehicle had been shot in excess of 20 times. There were no occupants in the vehicle. “Two separate blood trails were noticed leading further into the cane field in different directions. Officers followed the blood trails and discovered the bullet-riddled bodies of two men. They were fatally injured in the shooting,” Balram added. He said the motive for the shooting has not been confirmed at this stage and will be further investigated by police.
