A newborn baby girl was rescued in the  nick of time by pedestrians after she was dumped on a grassy patch along  Fernham Drive, Phoenix, on Thursday, 27 January. VIP Medics were called out to the scene and their spokesperson, Gareth Naidoo, said that patrolling KZN VIP officers were flagged down by pedestrians who had stumbled across the baby. He said: “The newborn was wrapped in a blanket and abandoned on the grass. The baby was assessed by medics and was found to be healthy. The baby’s umbilical cord had been clamped, leading medics to believe that the newborn had been at a medical facility.” Naidoo said the baby was transported to hospital and that the SAPS will be investigating the matter further after being informed about the incident. “It is fortunate that the baby was found this morning as the temperature has since spiked and would surely have harmed the little one,” added  Naidoo.
