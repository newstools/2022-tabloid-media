The Durban North-based youth organisation, Teens Under the Hood South Africa (TUTHSA), was the talk of the town when they hosted their first inter-community clean-up this weekend. Communities from all over KZN such as Phoenix, Waterloo, Bafalsdraai, Syndendam and Newdawn Park, just to name a few, all embarked on the journey to make their neighbourhood a cleaner place for all. “We feel blessed and encouraged to continue on our path. We intend to release many more inter-community projects where KZN will continue to stand united in making a difference. We are one family, one community,” said TUTHSA founder, Michelle Beaumont. She said that the streets of the various communities that participated are definitely cleaner and hopes that the positive energy from this past weekend will be felt across South Africa. “We intend to make this a yearly event and we will release smaller projects, similar to this one in the year. Beauty cannot describe what we witness happening. We would like to encourage others to start initiatives such as these or join some of ours. The joy of knowing that you have participated in something so meaningful is priceless.” Beaumont ardently believes that community is all about growing and supporting one another, a personal philosophy that pours into the many initiatives hosted by the organisation. “Being a part of a community makes us feel as though we are a part of something greater than ourselves. It gives us opportunities to connect with people, to reach for our goals, to make us feel safe and secure. A true community is about being connected and responsible for what happens. Not just watching, but actively participating and making a difference through their actions.” TUTHSA has their hands in many incredible community projects such as fitness training and hosting discussions on various life skills topics at schools.
