Shallcross residents are encouraged to make their nominations for the upcoming Community Policing Forum Sector elections. This comes after Chatsworth SAPS announced the sub-forum elections last week. Current chairperson of the Shallcross Community Forum (SCF), a registered NPC, Mahendra Lillkant said that he will not be contesting in the upcoming election. He said: “I would personally like to thank members of SAPS, Metro Police, neighbourhood watches, street watches, security companies, and my very dedicated team for the success we have achieved over the years. After much thought, deliberation and consultation with my loved ones, I have taken the very difficult decision of not contesting the upcoming CPF Sector elections.” Lillkant assured residents that community upliftment will continue to take place despite him not contesting his position in the election. “We will however continue with our community upliftment and civic projects as the SCF in conjunction with municipal support and private partnerships, and would appreciate your continued support in restoring our home to its former glory and beauty.  We welcome nominations from any resident who is passionate about protecting and serving our community. Please ensure that you participate in the upcoming elections to ensure that the best person is elected for the position,” he said. The election will be held on Thursday, 3 March with registration for nominations commencing at 6pm at the Shallcross Community Hall.
