A joint effort to crack down on crime in the Amanzimtoti area led to the arrest of 12 suspects in several suspect raids conducted by Amanzimtoti detectives in January. Amanzimtoti SAPS Communications Officer, Captain Charlene Van Der Spuy, said: “Twelve suspects were arrested for various contact and property related crimes such as murder, housebreaking and theft, general theft and malicious damage to property. Arrested suspects are still attending court and the detectives are confident they will be brought to book.” “Members in our community are encouraged to assist the detectives with information that can lead to the successful apprehension and conviction of suspects. Any Information received will be regarded as privileged and confidential. “The community is encouraged to continue reporting crime and any suspicious behaviour to the police. The police work hand in hand with the CPF sub-forums, security companies and armed response units looking at a proactive approach in keeping our area safe,” Cpt Van Der Spuy added.
