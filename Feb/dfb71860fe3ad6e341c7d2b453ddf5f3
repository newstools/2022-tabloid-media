The North Durban Lions Club celebrated the birthday month of the first Lion, Melvin Jones, who was born 13 January, by joining together with other Lions clubs within the Durban area to pack over 100 ‘jars of hope’. The president of the North Durban branch, Avril Hobbs, said Lions International was formed as a business club in 1917 by Jones, an American insurance broker who saw that you could be in business and serve the needs of the community. She said since then they have stuck true to their motto of ‘We Serve’, meaning that members help wherever a need may arise. Marking January as the official Lions Hunger Awareness Month, the celebration was extra special with the Durban pack zooming in on a similar Lions project in Pretoria. Hobbs said apart from the jars of hope project they are still involved in a monthly food parcel programme. She said: “North Durban packages 50 to 60 hampers monthly which are distributed to SASSA pensioners via TAFTA. In addition, we support sight/vision projects by screening learners at school and ensuring they receive spectacles if required,” said Hobbs. The North Durban club is 53 years old and is part of Jones’s legacy which boast 1.4 million members worldwide. “North Durban has 20 members currently, but anyone wanting to follow their passion in the community is welcome to come along to join. The members themselves fund the Lions’ administration, while all funds raised from the public are used to uplift the community,” Hobbs added.
