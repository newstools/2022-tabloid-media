Phoenix top-ranked fighters fought for glory on Sunday at the KZN Provincial Championships to secure the top four podium spots that guaranteed them a place in the forthcoming KSA Nationals 2022, which will take place in Durban and Gauteng in March.  Sensei at Skisa Northmead Dojo, Lorraine Munsami, said the event was a success. She said everything went according to schedule. “We had a unanimous amount of karatekas that were chosen to represent their province.” Sensei Munsami said the SKISA organisation is all about uplifting and motivating their karatekas. “They aim to produce the best athletes with sportsmanship, character and ethics. SKISA grooms karatekas to be the best they can be and become future champions. Karate helps one to remain focused and disciplined. It helps to boost the karatekas’ confidence and makes them believe that they can conquer the world,” said Sensei Munsami. The sensei added that she was extremely proud of her Northmead Dojo champions. “My champions have been rewarded for their hard work. Due to hard work and dedication my students have achieved such outstanding results,” she said. Shihan Brando Pillay, Technical Convenor and Karate South Africa Head Coach, said the athletes preformed phenomenally. “I’m looking forward to the Karate KZN Team’s performance in the upcoming Karate South Africa National Championship to be held in Durban in the first week of March,” said Shihan Pillay. President of SKISA, Hanshi Sonny Pillay, said: “As always SKISA Northmead Dojo members, who are coached by Sensei Lorraine Munsami, were among the medalists, with some bagging gold.” For any information regarding the SKISA Northmead Dojo, contact Sensei Lorraine Munsami on 084-380-9934.
