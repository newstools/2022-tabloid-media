A national oversight visit was done by Baxolile Nodada, MP, DA Shadow Minister of Basic Education, Dr Imran Keeka, MPL, DA KZN Spokesperson on Education at Windsor High School, recently.  “It was pleasing to see that all learners are fully back in school with teachers excited to now teach without repeating lessons, however, there are deep historic challenges in these schools that we will surely take up,” said Dr Imran Keeka. Dr Keeka said that these challenges are mainly related to infrastructure and vacancy of educators in critical and technical subjects. Windsor Secondary School was completely flooded and lost school furniture and textbooks with no departmental interventions. This is all at the expense of access to knowledge and quality teaching in the classroom for learners. “Two weeks later, the Department is actually surprised that the school fully re-opened because of the interventions of our Shadow MEC, Dr Keeka, in working with the principal to get private sponsorship and donations to get the school in working condition, however, the Department must provide textbooks, furniture and provide some infrastructure relief,” added Dr Keeka.
