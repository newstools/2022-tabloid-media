Not just for our fans, but for the musicians and artists who have had to struggle without work for so long. This is why this is a particularly special event for us, as we work together to reignite the live music scene and to prioritise our local artists in the process. To say we are excited for the Easter long-weekend is an understatement,” said Splashy Fen Festival Director, Stu Berry. Thursday, 14 April, will kick off the festivities with a selection of musicians across the four unique stage areas. Fans can look forward to the sounds of the Honeymooners, Mahala, Holy Funk, Isigqisasekhaya, and Freddy-L on the Acoustic Stage. The Treehouse Stage will host Lindo M, Angel Mazibuko, The Kickstands, and more; while The Main Stage area will be quiet on Thursday, but only for those not wearing the Silent Disco headsets blasting a selection of golden oldies and latest dance releases. Friday’s line-up will include Hayden Rattray, Nipho Hurd, Jason Gladwin, Faraway George, Zen Garden, and more on the Acoustic Stage; Shawn Miller, Dawn Morey, David Fisher and a selection of DJs at the funky Treehouse Stage; while the River Stage will blast the sounds of Tanner Wareham, Out Cry and South Wolves from 10.45am, and the Main Stage festivities will kick off with Mali Zulu, 4AM, Steve Umculo, Veranda Panda and the legendary Mango Groove. <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-69303" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600,h_400/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1068/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_630/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1200/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Splashy-Fen-Day-2-Friday-1-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />The Main Stage will open with Abaqgqobi on Saturday afternoon from 5pm, followed by Martin Gill, Neon Dreams, the Jägermeister Brass Cartel, Goodluck, and all-time crowd-pleasers – Mi Casa.
