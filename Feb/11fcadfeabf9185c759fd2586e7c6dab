It’s back-to-school for all primary school and special needs learners after Cabinet agreed to scrap the 1metre social distancing rule in the classroom as the country exits the fourth wave of the Covid-19. The Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, said in a meeting held on 31 January, Cabinet had approved the easing of the Adjusted Level 1 Covid-19 regulations based on the consultation between the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) and the President’s Coordinating Council (PCC), which receives updates on the management of Covid-19 in South Africa. He said, “The information gathered through the system used by the Department of Health has reported that South Africa has exited the fourth wave nationally. Based on the trajectory of the pandemic and the levels of vaccination in the country, Cabinet has decided to make the changes to Adjusted Alert Level 1 with immediate effect”. Among the changes made is the return to school for learners and isolation protocols for those infected with coronavirus. “Primary, secondary and special schools will return to daily attendance. The regulatory provision for social distancing of 1meter for learners in schools has also been removed. The Ministers of Health and Basic Education will in the coming days issue directives reflecting on this new approach.” In regards to those infected with Covid-19, Gungubele said people who test positive with no symptoms do not have to isolate. “If you test positive with symptoms, the isolation period has been reduced from 10 to seven days. Contacts do not have to isolate unless they develop symptoms. The rationale for these amendments is informed by the proportion of people with immunity to Covid-19 which has risen substantially, exceeding 60-80% in several sero-surveys,” Gungubele said.
