Work is underway to restore power to parts of Phoenix following a cable fault in Rydalvale which left the area without electricity from Tuesday afternoon, 1 February.  The fault affected the entirety of the Rydalvale and Starwood areas, which were left without electricity for over 20 hours. Ward 49 Councillor, Tino Pillay, said that technicians are currently on-site working on getting the power restored in the affected areas.  Cllr Pillay said: “Technicians are still working with the fault in the Rydalvale area. The substation that we tried to restore power on has collapsed due to extensive vandalism by criminals. The relevant department has obtained a new substation to replace the damaged one and power should be restored today.”
