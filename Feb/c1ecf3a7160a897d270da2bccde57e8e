In the statement, the NICD said: “These posts allege either that there are currently cases of enteric fever in certain towns or provinces caused by contaminated municipal water, or that the bacteria causing enteric fever have been identified in certain municipal water sources. These statements are factually incorrect and there is no evidence that recent cases of enteric fever are linked to contaminated municipal water in any part of the country, and there is no evidence that the bacteria causing enteric fever have recently been identified in municipal water sources anywhere in the country. This includes those districts in Western Cape and North West provinces in which the clusters of small localised outbreaks have been identified.” EThekwini Municipality also issued a statement following the panic on social media and a number of queries they received about this fever. Municipality Spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said: “The City would like to confirm to the public that its potable water is not contaminated and is safe to drink. This confirmation comes after a message circulating on social media to the effect that tap water is contaminated. The public should note that this misleading message is faceless, which proves that the author’s intention is to create unnecessary panic to the public.  “EThekwini water is tested in accordance with South African National Standard (SANS)241 to ensure quality. Non-compliances are checked and followed up in line with internal protocols and set procedures. The Municipality is appealing to all its customers to ignore these messages at all times and only heed those coming from the City’s official sources of public information.”
