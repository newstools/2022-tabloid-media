Managing Director of Stillwater Sports and Founder of the Absa RYC Series, Michael Meyer, said: “What better way to show your love for running than by taking on ‘The Love for Running 5km’ on Valentine’s Day. It’s a fun way to kickstart the year and we are proud to provide a platform for runners, both loyal and new, to connect with one another as we build a stronger, healthier and more active RYC Series running community. So grab your significant other, family members or friends and join us for ‘The Love of Running 5K’ on Monday, 14 February.” Meyer said the challenge is from 5am to 11pm and runners need to complete their 5km run or walk within this time period. “Remember to share your experience, pictures and routes to the RYC Series Strava Club page to go into a lucky draw. A pair of magnificent Puma Nitro running shoes is up for grabs,” added Meyer. Runners who have not joined the club yet will need to create a Strava account before they can join the club. Runners are to join ‘The Love of Running 5K’ event on the RYC Series Running Club by clicking on the orange “I’m in” button displayed next to the event listing. Thereafter runners must record their run using a smartphone  device or smart watch. All activities logged during the event period must be uploaded to Strava no later than 11pm on Monday, 14 February 2022. “All runners and walkers who complete ‘The Love of Running 5K’ and share their activity to the RYC Series Running Club on Strava within the stipulated time frame stand the chance of winning a pair of Puma Nitro running shoes and the winner will be selected by random draw and announced on the RYC Series Running Club page on Tuesday, 15 February,” said Meyer.
