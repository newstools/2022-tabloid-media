Reports of unsafe E. coli levels have kept both the City and the public on high alert and fearful of undertaking recreational activities since the Municipality’s warning before the festive season last year. Laura Washington, a concerned resident, who is part of a network of concerned citizens, said the group did a test of the E. coli levels before, however, the operation became too costly. “We, as a community, are already paying rates, taxes and surcharges for the Municipality to provide water and sanitation services but they’re simply not doing that. Residents are financially stressed and cannot afford to use more money on services that should be provided by the Municipality.” Washington said she was appalled by the findings of E. coli and other pollutants in the rivers. “However, it doesn’t surprise us as this has been growing over years. All efforts of community activism were ignored by the Municipality. This impacts on everyone living close to the river and those who use these waters for recreational facilities.” She said the Municipality blatantly ignores its residents and ratepayers. “We get brushed off when we request information and it’s only in extreme circumstances that we get any response.” Stephanie Wickham, another resident who expressed concern over the pollution levels, said there was a time when the Umbilo River was abundant with fish, crabs and eels. “Even birds used to drink from it, but now there is nothing except rubbish and dirt. We report it daily but nothing ever seems to help. The sewer lines are in bad shape and are not maintained, so much so that there is so much bush around, it takes the officials at least a day to locate the manholes. The other concern is the fact that none of the sewerage pump stations around Durban seem to work. “The state of the harbour is disgusting and the entire area smells terrible. I don’t know how people in the restaurants there deal with it but it is horrific. I volunteer down at the harbour and sometimes we have to swim for training and we have to really wash our gear afterwards and make sure we don’t swallow any of the water otherwise we end up horribly ill. The amount of sewage floating in the harbour is another disturbing factor,” Wickham said. Ward 62 Proportional Representative (PR) Councillor, Yogis Govender, said the Democratic Alliance in eThekwini Municipality is calling for an urgent investigation into the water quality levels of the rivers and beaches within eThekwini’s jurisdiction.  “This comes after a series of dubious closures and re-opening of the beaches during December 2021 and January 2022 and reports of visibly polluted waterways and beaches.”  She said in a recent report by water consultancy Talbot, E. coli readings that were taken on 5 February reflected shocking levels of E. coli in Kingfisher Canoe Club (Blue Lagoon), Johanna Road Pump Station, Northern Wastewater Treatment Works and Mount Moreland Bridge. In a statement released by the eThekwini Municipality on Thursday, 17 February, the public was cautioned about the state of water quality at the uMngeni River. The notice read: “The public and water sport organisers are hereby informed that routine water quality monitoring at the Umngeni River still confirms high E.coli levels. This is due to sewage overflow from some eThekwini sewerage pump stations that are constantly vandalised. Repairs have been made on two pump stations and are now operating. However, the Johanna Road pump station feeding Umhlangane River which joins Umngeni river is still under repairs. The Water and Sanitation Department is dosing the storm water overflow with Chlorine tablets. For this reason, Blue Lagoon Beach remains closed until further notice. Recreational activities at Umngeni and Umhlangane Rivers are not recommended. The outlet from the Northern Wastewater Treatment Works is being dosed with sodium hypochlorite. The public will be informed once it’s safe to use the water. The city apologises for any inconvenience caused.”
