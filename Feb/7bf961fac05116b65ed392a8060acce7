Star Senior Citizens Club has re-opened its doors, almost two years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, after being forced to closed for the safety of their members. On Wednesday, 9 February, the members gathered bright and early and spent the day engaging in fun-filled activities and conversations over breakfast and lunch at Lenham Primary School in Esselen Crescent. Long standing member of Star Senior Citizens, Meena Shreeram, said: “Our opening day was very exciting as we all met after two years of lockdown. We spent the day catching up with friends and sympathised with those who lost loved ones due to Covid-19.” “Breakfast and sumptuous lunch was provided and enjoyed by all the members. We are all looking forward to our weekly gatherings of fun activities, treats, outings, entertainment and so much more,” said Shreeram. Members will meet every Wednesday from 9.30am.
