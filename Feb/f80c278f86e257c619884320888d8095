MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation, Hlengiwe Mavimbela, has condemned the burning of a library in Ezakheni, Alfred Duma Municipality, which was set alight on Tuesday morning, 1 February.  After hearing about the incident, MEC Mavimbela visited the library as soon as possible to assess the damages and to engage the staff working at the library. Some of the damages include burned computers, chairs, shelves, air-conditioners and books. “It is quite sad to see such damage caused in a facility which is supposed to be helping our communities. This library, which is the only one in Ezakheni, services at least 30 schools, one TVET College and four other surrounding wards in Mcitsheni and St Chads,” said MEC Mavimbela. The MEC pleaded with people to protect government buildings, such as libraries, as they are meant to bring services closer to communities. “We also call upon anyone who can help to identify these perpetrators to come forward and work with law enforcement to ensure that these people are caught.” The burning of Ezakheni library comes at a time when the Department of Arts and Culture is commemorating the 13th annual World Read Aloud Day. “What saddens us more is that the children of Ezakheni, instead of celebrating with the rest of the world and participating in World Read Aloud Day, woke up to a burned library,” added MEC Mavimbela.
