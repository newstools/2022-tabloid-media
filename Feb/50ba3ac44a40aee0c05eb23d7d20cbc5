The victim sustained head injuries and is currently in hospital; the accused was arrested by Estcourt Police. The DA have expressed their concern over the stabbing incident. “It is alleged that there was a bullying incident which was reported to the principal, and not acted upon, that spiralled into this terrible act of criminality on the school premises,” said DA Spokesperson on Education, Dr Imran Keeka, MPL. Dr Keeka further stated that the victim of the stabbing is alleged to be the bully and initiator of the scuffle. “My interaction with SAPS suggested that they will thoroughly investigate the matter. I will write to MEC Mshengu to ask him to look into the allegation that the principal did not act when the bullying matter was raised as well as to look at how weapons ended up on the school premises. I am hopeful that the MEC will act swiftly to ensure that, at the very least, at this school, the levels of accountability and safety will be enhanced. We know that school safety in KZN is already compromised.”
