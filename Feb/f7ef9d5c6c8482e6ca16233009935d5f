A motorist endured a traumatic ordeal when he was accosted by two gun-wielding suspects on Leicester Road in Mobeni, recently. Montclair SAPS Communications Officer, Captain Derek Vijiam, said: “The victim was at the service station on Leicester Road in Mobeni, fuelling his tank of a white Isuzu, when he was accosted by two unknown males who were in possession of a firearm. The victim was threatened when the suspects pointed the firearm at him and demanded his vehicle. They removed his cellphone and his wallet from him. The petrol attendant, together with the victim, was instructed to lay on the ground. The suspects entered the vehicle and drove off.” Any person who can assist with information that would help the investigation can contact the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Sifiso Shezi, on 079-500-0836.
