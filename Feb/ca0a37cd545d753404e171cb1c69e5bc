Staff of Sumitomo Rubber South Africa tyre manufacturing plant rallied together with emergency services and the Alfred Duma Municipal Fire Department to contain a fire outside the factory, which broke out on 7 February. Billowing black smoke and metre-high flames could be seen as firefighters and staff worked together to extinguish the blaze. Community members from Steadville had gathered along Helpmekaar Road and watched the flames. “We just saw black smoke and knew something was wrong when the factory’s alarm had gone off,” said one of the bystanders, who stood across the street and watched the event unfold.   Lubin Ozoux, CEO of Sumitomo Rubber South Africa, one of South Africa’s largest tyre manufacturing companies and manufacturer of the Dunlop tyre brand, confirmed that a limited quantity of tyres outside the factory caught alight and all employees on site were successfully evacuated in line with their safety protocols. There were no injuries or casualties, nor was there any damage to property. “Employees rallied together to swiftly to ensure the fire was contained. We would like to thank and commend them for their commitment and assistance. We also commend the Alfred Duma Municipality Fire Department for its swift assistance in containing the situation,” added Ozoux. The cause of the fire is not yet known and an investigation will take place.
