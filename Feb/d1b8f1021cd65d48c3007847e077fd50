Ward 73 Councillor Ronnie Pillay was excited to present two outdoor gyms in Ward 73, recently. The respective gyms have been set up on both the Municipal Sports fields situated at the corner of Arena Park Drive and Montdene Drive, with the second situated above the Animal Clinic in Arena Park Drive. “The main purpose of these gyms is to allow residents to become physically fit. It must be remembered that being overweight has become the cause of so many critical illnesses. Residents are therefore urged to access the free gym facilities. Council further maintains any form of exercising must become part of our lifestyle. Residents are encouraged to safeguard these facilities from theft and vandalism. The outdoor gym is open to all residents regardless where they reside. I humbly appeal to those using the gym to follow all Covid-19 protocols,” he said. The third outdoor gym for Ward 73 will be implemented in the later part of the year.
