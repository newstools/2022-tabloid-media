To celebrate Palindrome Day this past ‘Twos Day’ (Tuesday), educators from St Elizabeth’s Pre-Primary School, a school based in Westville wore colourful tutu skirts on 22 February 2022.  Palindrome Day happens when the days can be read the same way backward and forward. The dates are similar to word palindromes in that they are symmetrical. Joining the fun was St Lizzie’s Zodwa Dlamini, Trish Oom, the school principal, Penny McIntyre and Bev Jarman.
