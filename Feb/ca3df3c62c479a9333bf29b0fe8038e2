EThekwini Municipality’s head of communication, Lindiwe Khuzwayo, said the City will continue to monitor the situation at China Mall Emporium to ensure the safety of the public following a fire that gutted the building. “The building has been condemned following assessments by structural engineers appointed by the building’s owners at the request of eThekwini Municipality. Businesses in the precinct have been evacuated while some road lanes remain closed as the structural integrity of the building is believed to be compromised,” said Khuzwayo. She added that the lane closures have resulted in high traffic volumes on Brooke Street and Dr Pixley Kaseme Street near the building. “Motorists are urged to be patient when driving in the vicinity. Three lanes on Anton Lembede Street remain open as advised by structural engineers. The City’s fire and emergency services will continue to maintain a presence near the building as a safety precaution. The public is urged to avoid the vicinity of the building if possible and use alternative routes. The public will be informed if there are further developments,” she said.
