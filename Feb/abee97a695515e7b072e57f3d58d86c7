The community has been experiencing extreme power cuts, with some streets going two to three days without electricity. The question which has been topical among the residents is that of the substation on Clark and Bulwer roads which has not been functional ever since it was built a few years ago.  Bulwer Urban Safety and Regeneration Forum Chairperson, Heather Rorick, said: “These regular power cuts and faults are ridiculous, seeing that we have an enormous building that was built in a hurry a few years ago supposedly as a bigger substation to deal with our community as all the little power stations around were old. “This new power station that cost money to build, is costing to maintain and has not been operational for a few years now. We just hear so many different excuses on why it’s not been connected, yet in the meantime the residents of Glenwood and Umbilo suffer the consequences of hours and even days without electricity, and without compensation to these households that suffer loss of food items etc.” Rorick said the recent humid weather conditions have also brought no joy to the residents, as many of them are at a crime risk. “Many residents have to sleep with windows open to get some cool air as their fans and air conditioners are not working during these power cuts and the weather is boiling.” The eThekwini Municipality Spokesperson, Lindiwe Khuzwayo, said the Glenwood substation is 90% complete but it will take another six to nine months for it to be fully functional. “Highly specialised equipment is needed for its completion which still needs to be imported,” said Khuzwayo. She said delays were caused by the negative impact of Covid-19 as international equipment orders were constantly postponed or cancelled because of the pandemic.  “However, now that lockdown restrictions have eased and borders have opened, a new equipment order has been placed and once it arrives, work on the substation will resume. We apologise for the inconvenience,” Khuzwayo added.
