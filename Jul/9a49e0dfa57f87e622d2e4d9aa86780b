The multi-award winning Gospel project which produces dynamic singers and musicians, majority from KZN, will be launching their 26th album, ‘Joy’, at the Durban Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Friday and Saturday, 29 and 30 July, and possibly on Sunday, 31 July, depending on public demand. In preparation for the launch, Durban ICC hosted members of MTN Joyous Celebration and the media for a breakfast meeting to give an outline on the aim of the benefit concert, also giving a chance for the partnering organisations to officially announce their collaboration for this concert. Durban ICC CEO, Lindiwe Rakharebe, welcomed the guests and said it was an honour to once again have the MTN Joyous Celebration back in Durban. She said: “After the serve floods which claimed lives and displaced over 4 000 people, it is good to have such an initiative in Durban. Even though the victims have received some sort of relief from government and non-profit organisations, there is still a need for support, as people are still suffering. As the ICC we are committed to giving back to the community and that is why we will be hosting this concert. We have visited some of the mass centres and shelters and assisted where we could. With this concert, we aim to uplift the spirit of the community, bringing them ‘joy’.” She said even people from the USA have shown interest in coming to the concert. “From the USA, the concert will be attended by Pastor TD Jakes, Pastor Joel Osteen and his daughter. They said if I bring Joyous Celebration, they will definitely be coming,” Rakharebe added. She said the ICC is proud to collaborate with African Global Network and MTN Joyous Celebration in putting back the ‘joy’ into the lives of the flood victims. MTN Joyous Celebrations’ Project Director, Mali Thabethe, who has been with the group for 21 years, said it was good to be back in Durban. “We would like to thank the ICC for opening its doors once again for us. Ticket sales for the benefit concert for Saturday have been sold out, however, we just have 10% left for Friday’s show to be fully booked and this shows the phenomenal support we receive from the community of Durban and KZN as a whole. Twenty percent of the concert proceeds will go towards supporting the severely affected victims and this is our way of giving back. It is our way to show the victims that we are with them,” said Thabethe. She said a team will make themselves available on Thursday, 21 July, and Saturday, 29 July, to join the African Global Network and eThekwini Human Settlements Department on their Thursday programme where they will assist the flood victims in the various areas and hopefully assist in the rebuilding of their homes. Thabethe thanked the supporters, partners and eThekwini for allowing them back for this auspicious concert which promises to be the best ever held. She urged those who will be coming to the concert to come in comfortable shoes as there will be lots of dancing, praying, crying and worshiping on both nights.
