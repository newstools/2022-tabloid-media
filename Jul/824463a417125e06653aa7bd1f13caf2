SANBS encourages the public to take part in the recently launched Good Hood campaign and spend a portion of their 67 minutes for Mandela Day on saving lives by donating blood in their communities. Having to travel to donor centres is a common reason people give for not giving blood, the recently launched Good Hood campaign aims to bring blood donation to the people and reach donors within their communities by bringing community-minded individuals together at their residential complex or community centre, to conveniently make their donation. “The Good Hood campaign makes the donation process convenient and addresses the misnomer that setting up a blood drive is admin intensive and requires lengthy management and planning. All you have to do is get in touch with us, tell us where you are and we will arrange to come and set it up for you,” says Thandi Mosupye, SANBS Senior Manager of Marketing and Communication. Mosupye urged individuals who have always wanted to get involved in community work, to take up this opportunity to make their contribution through blood donation. This Mandela Day, take the first step in hosting a blood drive in your neighbourhood by getting in contact with us. This is in line with this year’s theme “Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.” The campaign is rooted in the concept of getting communities to band together to assist blood recipients who live among them in their neighbourhoods. To recognise the generosity and selflessness of each participating community, SANBS would love to publicly acknowledge and celebrate each neighbourhood, as a Good Hood. “We want to appeal to everyone’s inclination towards civic responsibility, for this campaign to be successful,” Mosupye added. “Being labelled a Good Hood will show others that blood donation does not just have to be an individual activity – it can become a community and family activity too.” Through this campaign, SANBS intends to give recognition to the communities made up of individuals, who donate blood voluntarily to save lives. The blood service urges everyone to band together and be a part of the live-saving movement. To set up a blood drive contact SANBS on 0800119031 or visit https://sanbs.org.za/.
