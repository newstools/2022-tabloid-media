The eThekwini Municipality is investigating the sale clothing with their logo on it, labelling it as fraudulent activity that needs to be stopped. This follows a viral social media post, on Facebook, that has sparked fear among Phoenix residents who are seeing a spike of robberies by criminals presenting themselves as municipal employees. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, Eastbury resident, Joshian Naicker, said there has been an alarming increase in robberies by criminals who enter resident’s properties with the intention of robbing them and become violent. He said: “When I initially saw the post, I assumed that it was a joke, however, when I looked more into the post I realised  that there are people who are selling clothing items with the eThekwini Municipality logo printed on it and I was outraged.” Naicker said by people selling these fake municipality clothing it is giving criminals an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. “I really do hope something will be done about this and that the people who are selling these clothing items are fined and stopped. As it is, there are so many robberies and people are getting murdered due to criminals entering their homes. With things like this being sold so openly it will only increase the rate of criminal activities in the community,” said Naicker. Municipal spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, who has been made aware of the alleged unlawful use eThekwini logo, said: “The matter will be investigated. We urge residents to report such matters to the City Integrity and Investigations Unit on 080 020 2020.”
