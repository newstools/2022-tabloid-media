Police Minister Bheki Cele accompanied by MEC of Human Settlements and Public Works, Jomo Sibiya held a stakeholders’ meeting at the Ugu Sport and Leisure Centre in Gamalakhe with taxi owners and concerned role players of the sector within the Ugu and Harry Gwala Districts. The meeting was called due to rising cases of fatal taxi feuds which poses danger for taxi owners, drivers, members of the taxi industry leadership and the taxi commuters. Since last year 24 people from Ugu and Harry Gwala Districts have been casualties of these fatal shootings. In an attempts to improve the safety of taxi commuters, operators and owners, Minister Cele will lead the establishment of a multi-pronged Task Team, comprising of various government departments and structures. Minister Cele said: “The death toll due to taxi violence has more than tripled compared to the same period last year where five people killed in this area. If there is no special intervention we might reach crisis proportions, so we can’t fold our arms and say this is a transport problem only. This is a safety issue that needs police intervention and a buy-in from other departments to deal with some of the underlying causes of this violence.The fact that some taxi associations can collect millions of rands annually through member fees which are not taxed and the officials can decide how to use that money cannot be allowed to continue.” He added that the Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison officials led by the Acting MEC Jomo Sibiya, will rope in officials from the South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO) South African Revenue Services (SARS) and Special Investigation Unit (SIU). “The enforcement of the law should also see the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrest the hit men and the masterminds behind the senseless taxi related attacks and murders,” he said.
