The Robin Hood Foundation is encouraging communities to give back during Mandela Month by supporting a number of initiative that are organised by the non-profit organisation. Jackie Psannis, The Robin Hood Foundation co-ordinator, said the organisation had numerous calls from both individuals and corporates seeking suggestions on how they can help or get involved. “On 22 July please join us at Mahala Tea at the Botha’s Hill Chef School for a fun morning of tea, treats, prizes and two motivational talks from Cindy Norcott and I. There is no entrance fee but we would love you to bring a bag of pre-loved clothes, shoes, linen and household goods to donate at the door. We will also be painting the Esibusisweni orphanage. Lots of happy painting hands are needed here please. Jump in and help paint and if you have any brushes, trays or rollers to bring along we would be most grateful,” said Psannis. The foundation will also be manning a table on 23 July at the Comrades route test run, halfway down from Pietermaritzburg and will be cheering and handing out drinks to the runners, including their very own Werda Groeneweld who is running for The Robin Hood Foundation to raise money for the training and learnership programs they are invested in. These learnerships are in trades such as welding, woodwork, sewing and painting. “We are adding other learnerships in our mission to create independent, sustainable income streams for as many KZN communities as possible. We would greatly appreciate your support towards Werda’s fundraising journey. Throughout the month we would appreciate sponsorship or donations of animal food for dogs and cats or bedding for several animal rescue homes and centres that we support. If you would like to donate R67 to support our initiatives we would be most grateful,” said Psannis.
