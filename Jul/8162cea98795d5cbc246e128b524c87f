Paulpietersburg SAPS are investigating a farm attack and a case of attempted murder after a 58-year-old Paulpietersburg farmer was shot in the leg during a farm attack on Sunday afternoon, 3 July. “It is alleged that the victims were accosted by three suspects who were carrying firearms and a knife. The 58-year-old complainant tried to fight off the suspects and he was shot in the leg. The matter is still under investigation,” said SAPS Spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala.  In light of the recent attack, the Democratic Alliance (DA) have said they are deeply concerned by the attempted murder of the Paulpietersburg farming family. “The Klingenberg family were attacked by three armed suspects and Lothar Klingenberg’s wife managed to escape without major harm, but he is still recovering in hospital after being shot in the leg,” said Elma Rabe, MPL, DA KZN Spokesperson on Agriculture and Rural Development. Rabe further said that it is very clear that this ANC-run government feels nothing for our farmers and rural communities and that it is equally clear that the government has no plans to assist such communities by introducing the rural safety unit that is so desperately needed. “The DA-led Western Cape government has implemented a rural safety strategy which has already led to reduced attacks on such communities. The questions are, what is KZN’s ANC-run government waiting for? Is it simply too stubborn to learn from best practice or is there something we don’t know?” The DA has written to MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi, appealing to her to take the plight of our rural communities seriously. “We have also indicated our willingness to work with her and her department to fight this scourge and urge the MEC to be more proactive in getting her Community Safety counterpart to do more. Farmers and farmworkers are critical to our economy and our everyday lives. They must be protected,” concluded Rabe.
