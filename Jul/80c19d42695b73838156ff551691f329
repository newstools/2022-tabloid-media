July 13 marks an auspicious day in the Hindu calendar, the Day of Guru Purnima, where devotees offer their gratitude to their spiritual masters and in return receive blessings from their Guru.    According to the spiritual head of Jagrati Nauyuwak Sangh (Awakeness Youth Association), Pundit Suresh Singh, “The purpose of the Guru Purnima celebration is to review the preceding year to see how much one has progressed in life, to renew one’s determination and to focus on one’s progress on the spiritual path. As Hindus we should be looking at moving forward with the times and evolving – being a Hindu and stagnant is not an option anymore.” Pundit Singh said: “Guru Purnima is a sacred day to the memory of the great sage Vyasadeva. All Hindus should be indebted to Srila Vyasadeva who compiled the four Vedas, the 18 Puranas and the Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavad Gita). Srila Vyasadeva even taught Dattatreya, who is regarded as the Guru of Gurus. Guru Purnima is a good time to begin ones spiritual lessons. Traditionally, spiritual seekers commence to intensify their spiritual sadhana from this day. The period ‘Chaturmasya’ (four months) begins from this day.” “In the past, wandering spiritual masters and their disciples used to settle down at a place to study and discourse on the Brahma Sutras composed by Srila Vyasadeva and engage themselves in Vedantic discussions. The duty of the Guru is to help his disciple spiritually, he teaches him how to be detached from this material world and how to attach to the spiritual world, as we all know that the material world is full of pain and suffering where as the spiritual world is totally the opposite. Therefore Guru Purnima is a special day where the guru is worshipped and glorified. Devotees and disciples offer a garland to the Guru and sumptuous meals are prepared and offered to the Lord and thereafter distributed as prasadam,” added Pundit Singh.
