Registered specialist family physician and chairperson of the Independent Practitioners Association Foundation (IPAF) and KwaZulu-Natal Doctors Healthcare Coalition (KZNDHC) Professor Morgan Chetty was awarded with the Metropolitan Lifetime Award for Services in Healthcare on Saturday night.  The awards ceremony hosted by the KwaZulu-Natal Doctors Healthcare Coalition (KZNDHC) saw several healthcare providers that serve the healthcare sector of South Africa being recognised for the outstanding work that they do. Other award recipients for the night include, Professor Salim Karim, Dr Mvuyisi Mzukwa and Dr Barry Seetharam. The awards ceremony held at Elangeni Hotel was also attended by Deputy Minister of Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo.  Speaking about his recent award, Prof Chetty said he has been honoured with many lifetime achievement awards but this, is a special one and he is grateful and humble. “I have been working with Metropolitan Health with Dr Dyer for about 30 years. We started at the time it was Natal Medical Plan. Essentially we work on programs and profiling tools to improve the quality and efficiency of the products they were implementing. We were promoting best practice care. It was a long journey and we were privileged to have a great set of MMI field consultants to help us. We are grateful for the executive members and the consultants as we refined the offering. So it was really an honour to be recognised for this work. Both Dr Dyer and I are grateful and humbled by this award. Over the period we essentially became household names in the Metropolitan team,” he said. Prof Chetty is a visiting Professor in the Department of Health Sciences at the Durban University of Technology. He writes for the Medical Chronicle (Medical Journal) regularly and other Journals when invited to do so. Among his many other accolades, in 2019 Prof Chetty was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy (Honoris).
