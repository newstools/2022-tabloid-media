The non-profit organisation Food for Life Africa has received a boost of a solar powered system from ACDC Dynamics, which will save on electricity consumption as they continue to pioneer the eradication of hunger rapidly. Taking into account the recent flood damage, water shortages and the continuous load-shedding, one can imagine how daunting it must be to produce 16 000 meals daily especially under these circumstances. However, Food for Life Africa ensures that the hungry receive their daily meals without fail. The chairperson of the lead branch, Vicky Panday, said in just over two years, Food for Life Africa has prepared and distributed 8 750 000 nutritious meals in various communities, old age homes, children’s homes and schools around KwaZulu-Natal. “Our efforts and outcomes are only possible, through the generous support of donors and volunteers. We are ever grateful to ACDC Dynamics for the complete donation and installation of a solar powered system to ensure production continuity in our largest kitchen, at the River Range Ranch in Verulam,” Panday said. The solar powered system valued at R150 000 should save Food for Life Africa 50% of their electricity consumption. ACDC spokesperson, Mark Shear said: “We have seen first-hand the quality and the impact of the work Food for Life Africa is so passionately doing. Coming on board and ensuring their operations are uninterrupted was the least we could do to support their exemplary efforts. As a business we are invested in supporting the eradication of hunger in our country. This donation does not only reduce the electricity bill but ensures that Food for Life Africa has power when the utility is down.” He added: “We will be installing solar lighting on the peripheral of the building, this will save 100% on electricity consumption. As an experienced business in this industry we are privileged to be able to make this contribution and want to add light to similar organisations.”
