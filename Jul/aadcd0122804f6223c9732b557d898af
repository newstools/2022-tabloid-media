We will ensure that every client that is inside these selected offices at the time of closing receives service,” said Siya Qoza, the Ministerial Spokesperson.  Parents are reminded that kids must apply for smart ID cards when turning 16 years old or wait until the child is 18 years of age and in matric. No fee or photographs are required as they will be provided free of charge at the office.
