Musgrave Methodist Church is hosting a Saturday lunch fundraiser with a MasterChef inspired food fair in the church’s garden on 23 July, from 11am. Teams of competitors will be cooking up a storm with pre-selected ingredients to find the best meal in Musgrave! Competitors will be cooking al fresco on braais, Webers, potjies or skottels and will be preparing a selection of unusual main meals for visitors to enjoy. There will also be pudding and drink options available with a panel of judges who will choose the best meal of the day. Musgrave Methodist’s Pam de Wet, one of the organisers of the event, said the particular focus of this event is to raise money to restore and de-borer the church’s magnificent arched wooden roof. The idea is also to create awareness about the activities of the church and to enjoy unusual food, fellowship and great company. De Wet said that children attending the event will enjoy a jumping castle and play area and some hot dogs which will be on sale. “We are hoping our MasterChef food fair provides a fun, family-friendly, affordable alternative to a home-cooked lunch for families in Berea and beyond – and a chance to enjoy the company of friends and neighbours. Portions of the food can be purchased on a ticketing system (R100 for adults and R50 for children) and all profits go to Musgrave Methodist Church,” she added. Numbers are limited, so pre-booking is advisable. Should anyone want to participate with a team of cooks or donate ingredients – the church would love to hear from you!
