Women from the community of Phoenix and surrounding areas are invited to join the free Bollybix aerobics classes, to keep fit and to shake-off those winter chills. The dance classes are held at Woodview Primary and Earlington Secondary School, in Phoenix. The Bollybix aerobics class was formed by Shanon Mishca Bhojraj, the founder of the Shanon B Dance Academy. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, Bhojraj said: “Bollybix aerobics is a women empowerment weight loss and fitness class for ladies 18 years and older. Bollybix is a combination of taiebo, zumba, hip hop abs, dance, yoga, weight  training meditation and pilates. These classes have been specifically designed to help females with PCOS, endometriosis, thyroid issues, diabetes, cholesterol – to lose stubborn fat and for ladies who just want to be fit.”  Along with these empowering, high energy – power hour classes, free diet plans will be provided. “These classes are aimed at achieving a sisterhood and women empowerment, more than just a fitness class- we want the ladies to use this time to prioritise their self care routines and to make sure that their bodies are healthy. My aim is to also make plus size women enjoy their bodies. The natural botox for ladies living in a day and age of genetically modified food is exercise and healthy eating – which does not mean starving yourself or constantly consuming salads. It simply means eating what you enjoy in moderation, prepared in a much healthier way with lots of water,” said Bhojraj. She said: “We also do special chakra balancing and meditation classes to help these ladies get in touch with their spiritual side so they can become the best versions of themselves. Our classes are at beginner and intermediary phases, which is designed for ladies from all walks of life. All you need to join these classes is yoga mat, long towel, a sweat towel, water bottles and comfortable gym wear.” All interested in joining these classes are encouraged to WhatsApp 076 606 1701.
