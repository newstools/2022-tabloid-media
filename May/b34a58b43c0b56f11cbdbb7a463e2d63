“A mother is your first friend, your best friend, your forever friend.” Amanzimtoti based lifestyle digital content creator, Verushka Ramasami said Mothers’ Day is everyday for her as she spoils her all the time. On Sunday, 8 May is Mothers’ Day, a day  of celebrating and honouring the mother of the family or individual, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds and the influence of mothers in society. “My mother is my best friend, my critic, my travel buddy, my food taster, fellow book lover and not forgetting my plus at the events I attend. She was instrumental in teaching us about our culture, religion and heritage and for this I am forever grateful. As one gets older things start to be clearer and we see our parents in a different light. All their sacrifices, lessons and values unfold in-front of us,”said Ramasami.  She said her mother is her biggest and loudest cheerleader. “When I first moved to London, I missed home so much and it was then I realised the value of the relationship I shared with my mum. Since returning home after a good few years of living in London, my mum and I have developed an incredible relationship especially after my dad and grandmother passed away.There are days we do not see eye to eye but it does not last for long,” said Ramasami. Ramasami said she enjoys spending time with her mother and spoiling her for Mothers’ Day is on top of her list. The management and staff of the South Coast Weekly Gazette wishes all our readers and advertisers a Happy Mothers’ Day.
