The family of a Shelly Beach teenager who was recently diagnosed with cancer is appealing to residents to help raise funds for his treatment.  Logan Potgieter (15) was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. A type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the body’s germ-fighting immune system. His mother, Jana Potgieter said before being diagnosed with cancer, her son was a happy, bubbly person who loved playing video games and spending time with his friends. Logan is a former Port Shepstone High School learner and after his diagnosis he was severely affected, and had to start online schooling.  “He is in matric and has started with online schooling as his immune system is compromised from the chemo and he needs to be isolated to remain healthy. He has big ambitions of one day becoming an architect. He currently undergoes chemotherapy every two weeks, and he has ten more sessions to undergo as part of his recovery process,” she said.  Jana stated that cancer treatment is expensive. “We need about R100 000 for the remaining chemo sessions. As parents we are proud of Logan for his fighting spirit.” Jan added that Halfway Auto, Ford, Mazda and Hyundai will host a Fundraising Golf Day for Logan’s cancer treatment. The event will be held at the Port Shepstone Country Club on Saturday, June 25. She said to book a team and support the golf day, residents can contact the Pro Shop on 039-695-0140.  Residents who would like to donate towards Logan’s cancer treatment can contact his mother Jana, on 072-534-5695.
