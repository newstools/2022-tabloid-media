Youth of Destiny, an initiative which was created to keep the young people of Phoenix of the streets, hosted an awareness concert at the Pentecostal Family Covenant Church recently.  The youth concert, which has been hailed as a success by the organisers, was held under the theme ‘Youth against drugs’. The founder of Youth of Destiny, Melasa Isaiah, said the concert was well attended by youth from different churches, faiths and organisations.  She said: “The concert saw many young people having fun and different talents coming together to perform to make the concert a success. Members of the non-profit organisation, Jump Youth Mission, which works closely with the local youth, shared their experiences with drugs and being on the streets as well as being saved to minister the word of God.”  At the event, the youth were also encouraged to have hope even when feeling hopeless and helpless, and were informed about various resources available for help.  “It was such blessed afternoon with various talented musicians and dancers taking to the stage. I want to place on record my sincere gratitude to those who attended, performed and addressed the youth. I also want to appreciate our speakers, Sgt Merle Govender from SAPS Phoenix, Social Worker, Sharleen Pillay, Jump Youth Mission, Jesus Light Club and our many phenomenal guests. We are grateful to God for each of you,” said Isaiah.
