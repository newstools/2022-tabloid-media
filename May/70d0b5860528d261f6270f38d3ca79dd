By Nkosenhle Sibisi Pinetown resident, Pearl Holdstock said Mother’s Day is special to her after having battled infertility for over a decade. On Sunday, 8 May, people across the world will honour mothers, grandmothers, aunts and guardians as part of the Mother’s Day celebrations. The mommy blogger who has three beautiful children said, “This is a day I waited so long to celebrate. I love my journey as a mother and by far, this is the most important part of my life. Being a mother to me means being in partnership with God and raising his children to discover their purpose in life. It also means being able to love and be loved in return without any reservations or limitations.” Holdstock said she will spend Mother’s Day attending an event to celebrate with other mothers. “I will soak in all their wisdom when it comes to parenting because it takes a village to raise a child,” said Holdstock. She added that the best part about being a mother is seeing her children content, happy and carefree. “My children teach me the true meaning of life on a daily basis. When together, we enjoy outdoors activities weekly; we go on adventures where we learn something different and we talk about it the following week. We also enjoy picnics, play dates with other parents and cooking together,” said Holdstock.
