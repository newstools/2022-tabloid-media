Two security officers were shot and killed in Shallcross within hours of each other, one on Tuesday evening and the other on Wednesday morning. In the first incident, the owner of Amawele Emergency Services, Claude Subramodey, said they were called to Jamaica Garage in Shallcross for an armed robbery on Tuesday night. When their members arrived at the scene, they allegedly found that a security guard had been shot multiple times.  “Sadly there was nothing more that we could do for him as he showed no signs of life. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The body was handed over to SAPS members. The cashier was also assaulted and robbed,” said Subramodey.   In the second shooting, a security officer in his 30’s who guarded a local church on Wingen Walk Road, was gunned down on Wednesday, 4 May. Subramodey said: “We arrived at the scene to find that the officer was shot in his face. He showed no signs of life and was pronounced dead at the scene. All role players were contacted and the man’s body was handed over to the SAPS.” Meanwhile, charges of murder and attempted murder are being investigated by Bayview SAPS after a drive-by shooting claimed the life of one man and left three others seriously injured.  KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, said: “It is alleged that on 30 April 2022 at 10.40pm, at the intersection of Unity Avenue and Lenny Naidu Drive, four males were shot by unknown suspects while they were in a vehicle. The 37-year-old man was declared dead at the scene due to injuries sustained. The other victims were taken to hospital for medical attention. The motive for the attack is unknown.”
