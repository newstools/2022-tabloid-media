Zak Neethling, 15, will be celebrating Mother’s Day with his mother, Miranda Neethling. “My mother means everything to me and there are things that I could not have achieved if it was not for her love, continuous support and always encouraging me to be a better me,” Zak said. Zak said that he makes sure that he tells his mother how important she is to his world every day and not just on Mother’s Day. “There are many of us out there who don’t have the privilege of having a mother and it is for this reason, that I make sure that my mother knows every day not just on Mother’s Day, how incredibly lucky I am to have her. To call her my mom.” Zak said he would like to take this opportunity to wish his mother a happy Mother’s Day and thank her from the bottom of his heart, for her. The Ladysmith Herald management and staff would like to wish all mothers a happy and blessed Mother’s Day.
