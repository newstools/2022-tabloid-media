A 28-year-old man who was allegedly mistaken for a drug dealer was gunned down while asleep in an outbuilding on Ginger Road in Waterloo on Saturday morning. Private security company, Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), said they received a call for medical assistance and on arrival established that the victim had been shot and was unresponsive. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram said at approximately 5.10am, neighbours were woken by a number of gunshots fired in the area. He said upon investigation they found an unresponsive male bleeding from his injuries in a wood and iron home situated next to the main building. “Residents believe that the shooter targeted the wrong person as the hit may have been intended for a local drug dealer who bears a striking resemblance to the deceased. Upon examination, the man was found to have been shot in the head and body. Four spent 9mm cartridges were recovered.,” added Balram.
