Sunday, 8 May, is Mother’s Day and for mother-of-two, Bhavna Royepenn, the day will be filled with love and happiness as she celebrates the joys of motherhood which are her babies, five-year-old Cruz and two-year-old Zara Elizabeth Royeppen. Established in 1907, the holiday was first celebrated when Anna Jarvis held the initial Mother’s Day service in Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia. Since then, Mother’s Day has become one of the beloved holiday’s as families come together to celebrate the women in their lives that have made a huge impact in their upbringing. This weekend, mothers, grandmothers, aunts and guardians all across South Africa will be showered with gifts to make them feel special on their day. Royeppen said Mother’s Day is one of the holidays that she enjoys the most and looks forward to. The management and staff of Durban North News, along with Bhavna, Cruz and Zara Royeppen, wish all mothers a happy Mother’s Day.
