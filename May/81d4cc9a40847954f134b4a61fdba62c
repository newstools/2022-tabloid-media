On 8 May, mothers, grandmothers, aunts and guardians will be honoured and celebrated by their loved ones for being their pillars of strength. Mother’s Day is one of the beloved holidays as families come together to celebrate the women in their lives who have made a huge impact in their upbringing. Whether they are related by blood or by choice, mothers everywhere will be treated and spoilt. One mother who is looking forward to this Sunday is Shanelle Mistry from Phoenix, who will be celebrating ‘properly’ for the first time with her family, after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. A mother to her adorable one-year-old baby girl, Kylee Jordan, Shanelle said that she was looking forward to being pampered by her husband Sherwin as they celebrate Mother’s Day together. “For Mother’s Day I’m looking forward to spending time with my baby-girl and enjoying being a mother to the happy tot. This is my first Mother’s Day where Kylee will be fully active and running around. I love being her mom and I love being a mother. So every mother, aunt and grandmother out there should enjoy this day and be cherished by their families. Have a happy Mother’s Day,” Mistry said. The management and staff of The Phoenix Tabloid, together with Shanelle and Kylee Jordan Mistry, wish all mothers a happy Mother’s Day and may this special day be as lovely and perfect as you.
