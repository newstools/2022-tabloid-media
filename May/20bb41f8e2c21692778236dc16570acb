The Umdoni Municipality in partnership with the KZN Department of Economic Development,Tourism and Environmental Affairs are currently building 65 Scottburgh Market Stalls for craft and other traders with the aim of creating a conducive environment for local businesses to thrive. An upgrade of 18 units at Umzinto Bus Rank for traditional healers is also underway. A resident and community leader from Scottburgh, Emmanuel Msomi said the swift response from the Municipality is highly commendable as the Scottburgh Market was overdue for upgrades.  “I appreciate the quick response from Umdoni Municipality since the Scottburgh Market was becoming an unsafe working environment for our local informal traders.The current upgrades are going to uplift our community, boost the economy and will also reduce the rising crime rate, ” said Msomi. Umzinto Councillor and speaker of Umdoni Municipality, Mbalenhle Cele said the Municipality’s goal is to ensure everyone benefits from service delivery. “It is important that we create a conducive environment for local businesses to thrive,” said Cllr Cele. Umdoni Municipality Mayor, Cllr Sibongile Khathi said:  “The infrastructure investment made by Umdoni Municipality through the construction and renovation of market stalls in Umzinto and Scottburgh will tremendously improve the trading environment thus ensuring a significant contribution to the livelihood of the local economy. The municipality can attest that the Umzinto Stalls are at 95% completion following renovations of the ablution blocks, the security guard house, the roof and the installation of brand new doors for all trading units. The Scottburgh Craft Market and beach is also at an advanced stage. And as planned, this project will be completed by the end of May 2022. It is therefore imperative that informal traders are also taken care of to ensure a sturdier contest against the scourge of poverty and unemployment in our communities.”
