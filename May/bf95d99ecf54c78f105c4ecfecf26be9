With a strong passion for uplifting Phoenix, Moses has been involved in a number of projects that boost the well-being of children, youth and women in community. The Phoenix Tabloid recently sat on the couch the young woman to find out more about her life and her community activism. Phoenix Tabloid (PT): Tell us about yourself? Caela Moses (CM): My name is Caela Che Moses, I am 19 years old, I love spending time with my family, my dogs and my friends, I enjoy the little things in life, meeting new people and travelling to other countries. I dislike inequality and injustice of any kind. PT: Tell us about your family and what are some of your favourite parts of being among them? CM: I have many beautiful people that I call my family and they consist of people around me who are genuine at heart. My immediate family is my mum, my dad and my sister, I am the youngest. I think my favourite thing about my family is the caring spirit that they carry, each of them have warm hearts and are quick to help others, we have lots of fun and love travelling together  PT: Where do you reside? CM: I reside in Herrwood Park, uMhlanga, I’ve lived here for a little less than a year now. Before that, I lived in Phoenix for most of my life.  PT: Where did you attend high school and did you enjoy it? CM: I attended Greenbury Secondary School, in Phoenix. Yes, I enjoyed being around friends and getting to know teachers, some of whom I still speak to and who inspire me every day.  PT: Did you go onto further education? If so, where and what did you study? CM: I am currently studying at Wenzhou Medical University, in China, my degree is medicine (MBBS). I also have a certification to teach English as a second language and I’ve attended many courses, a media management course, a business course and others.  PT: What drove you to become involved with community projects, at such a young age? CM: To be completely honest, I think what drove me the most to this was watching my parents give back to their coomunity. My parents have both dedicated their lives to communities and have always prioritised helping others. They are community leaders, I’ve seen the difference that can be made through community projects and how lives can be touched. PT: What are some of the initiatives you have done or been a part of in the Phoenix area? CM: Wow, there are so many, I feel like I can’t pick. The most recent one I’ve done was with Well Ubekhale, I co-ordinated the Creative Stationery Drive for learners at the V.N. Naik School for The Deaf. That was really beautiful for me, because those children really do not have much and to see the smiles on their faces warmed my heart.   PT: Why is it so important for you to be a part of such initiatives? CM: It’s important to me because I see myself as the next generation leaders, to pick up the torch and run. It is easy to not care and not take the initiative, however it’s not easy to stay motivated and continuously have a heart to help others. Caring is shown in acts of kindness and young people have the ability to show care.  PT: what are you passionate about? CM: My passions includes helping people, I have dedicated my life and future career to help others. I am passionate about justice, equality and empowerment , living in a community were feeling hopeless can come so easily, we need more people who are able to empower and use their voice to help others. I am passionate about medicine and learning, one of my other great passions is travelling, I love seeing different places and meeting new people from different cultures and learning about them.  PT: Why is giving back to the community important to you? CM: It is important to me because to give back to the community is to follow God, Giving back shows love and compassion. When I saw my parents helping those who didn’t have as much, I realised how privileged I was, and with that privilege I see a responsibility, to give back and love others unconditionally.  PT: If you had a choice, South Africa or overseas? CM: I’d have to pick both, I have a zest for travelling. I’ve travelled to many countries and I love experiencing new cultures but home is where the heart is. I chose my profession based on helping others, so wherever there is a need, I will be there to lend a hand.  PT: What is one thing you would like other people to be more aware of and why? CM: In the times that we are living in it is evident that hope has been lost, KZN has experienced a real hardship in the past year, especially Phoenix. I want people to be aware of the fact that there is hope, hope for a better tomorrow even in hopeless situations. I believe that the community of Phoenix is the embodiment of its name – to rise from the ash. So although it has been difficult, we will always rise again, don’t lose hope.  PT: What are you known for? CM: I am most known for my heart, having a genuine and pure heart is not easy, but achievable. My intentions are not to be photo-shopped for doing good but when I help people, my heart is full and satisfied just to make someone else’s life better and expecting nothing in return is most rewarding to me.   PT: Being involved in many things such as community work and medical school, how do you juggle all your responsibilities? CM: Great question, in fact sometimes it feels impossible, the first thing I do is trust God, he knows all so I know with Him by my side, I never have to worry, He gives me strength and wisdom. I also have a great support system, my parents are amazing and it’s just having a good work ethic, pushing myself to be a better version of myself every day. I stay focused on my goals and understand that I am just a vessel to help others.   PT: What do you do during your free time? CM: During my free time, I love spending time with my family and friends, having conversations, eating good food. I love spending time with my dogs, I like to travel, see different places and experience new things. I also like watching movies and Netflix series to unwind.  PT: What are some of the titles you hold?  CM: Daughter, sister, friend, confidant, teacher, manager and in the future, doctor.  PT: What is your advice for other women who want to make a difference?  CM: Rise up! The world needs you, sometimes we find ourselves thinking someone else can make a change and not us but let me encourage you, anything you do will not be in vain. Be open, be honest, be bold, and be confident, you are the change that the world needs. As a woman you have a great purpose, women bring new life, out of you will come greatness, and don’t be swayed by difficulties. Do things with a pure heart and good intentions. Your willingness to support others will be the hope that the world needs.
