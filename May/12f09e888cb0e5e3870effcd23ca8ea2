The Acting Principal of Stonebridge Primary, Mrs L Govender, said the recent flooding has impacted the schools ailing infrastructure drastically and is hoping that the community can assist them during their time of need. She said: “There are numerous challenges and difficulties experienced by learners who attend our school as they come from poor socio-economic backgrounds and surrounding townships. They cannot afford to pay school fees. There are only 252 learners at school.” Govender added that the school has recently experienced a walk in robbery. “The schools laptop and cellphone was stolen from secretary’s office. Stonebridge Primary has a very low bank balance and we cannot afford full proof security. Due to the lack of payments of school fees, the school is now in arrears with electricity bill, as it stands at R830 000. We also have very low funding from government.” Govender said that due to the lack of funding, the school is in need of burglar gates for classrooms, window panes, window handles, fluorescent lights for classrooms, switches and light fittings, door handles, fencing wire, bins, rubber mats ,chairs, cupboards, desks, plumbing and toilets that need repairs. “An urgent appeal is made to the community and business houses to assist the school. I’m passionate and trust that together with the SGB, staff, parents and community, we can bring the school forward. Dr S.K. Singh the circuit manager has also been extremely supportive of our school,” added Govender.
