Egerton Primary School sportsfield was recently abuzz as the rugby and hockey teams faced off against Hutten Park School.  Sporting athletes could be seen not only braving the chilly morning air but muddy, drenched fields, due to heavy rains the night before. Rugby and hockey players had set up their strength in skills, as they battled it out for the victorious win. Parents and friends could be seen showing support as their little sports players became heroes on the sportsfield.
