The Phoenix Community Policing Forum (CPF) has welcomed their new chairperson, following a successful election process where Dinesh Pillay of Rydalvale was selected for the seat. Prior to his appointment, Pillay chaired the Sector 3 CPF for the last four years. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, Pillay said: “Over the last four to five years, I have been involved in various community and SAPS projects, bringing crime awareness initiatives to the residents of Phoenix. Currently a strategy on the key responsibilities the CPF will be undertaking is being put into place, on the way forward to include the community in combating crime.” When asked what are some of the changes he will be implementing in the CPF structure, Pillay said they are governed by a Constitution to which the whole country has to follow. “We as the new CPF body have some ideas going forward and we implore the community to attend all CPF meetings and join the various CPF WhatsApp groups to stay updated on the plans going forward. The best solution to curb the increasing crime statistics in Phoenix is for the community to report all crimes no matter how small it may seem, thus substantiating our call for more SAPS manpower and vehicles to be added to our current policing force within Phoenix,” he said.
