Mpumelelo Musa Mseleku, son of well known South Coast polygamist Musa Mseleku recently made his first professional football debut in the DSTV Diski Challenge for The ‘Dube Birds’ Moroka Swallows reserve team in a 3-1 loss against the ‘Mighty Amakhosi’ at the Dobsonville  Stadium in Soweto.  Mseleku, 21 hailing from a small village of Umzumbe became a popular figure through his family reality show titles, ‘uThando Nes’thembu’. A show which had the whole country and streets of South Coast buzzing with eagerness to learn more about the polygamist culture. The former Port Shepstone High School learner is man of diverse talents which include, being a DJ and television production which has led him to taking on his childhood dream of playing professional football. Mseleku said he believes the sky is the limit and it’s only a matter of time before he breaks into South Africa’s top flight league,The Premier Soccer League. “At the tender age of seven years, I was already kicking the ball in the dusty streets of Umzumbe where I was raised,” said Mseleku. “It was really exciting to make my debut for a big team like Moroka Swallows which has produced a number famous of South African football stars like Ruzaigh Gamildien who happens to be my role model,” said Mseleku. Mseleku added that his television popularity has nothing to do with his rise in the soccer fraternity. “Through hard work and dedication I managed to pass my soccer trails and that is why I’m playing for this club,” he said. “Things did not happen automatically because of my father or my family’s popularity. I want to get more game time to help the team climb up the log until my name is recognised in other countries,” said Mseleku. “I want to raise the South Coast flag high and I believe upcoming footballers from the South Coast must chase their dreams because you never know when your time will come. When the opportunity arises you must be ready to grab it with both hands,” said Mseleku.
