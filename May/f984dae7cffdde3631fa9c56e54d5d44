With the City’s beaches being closed and high levels of pollution in Durban harbour, the race organisers had no choice but to move the iconic race to a new date. The popular annual race starts at the Silt Canal on the Bluff and traverses Durban harbour before completing an out-and back lap in the ocean to the uMngeni River before finishing at the Durban Underwater Club. “The health and well-being of every single participant will always come first,” said race committee head, Neels Meyer, who confirmed that all the entries that had already been taken for the event would be transferred to the new date – 26 June. Race Two has also been postponed as bad weather battered Durban recently. Organisers of the Marine Winter Surfski Series have postponed the Marine Golden Mile Challenge which was due to be held at Marine SLC on Sunday morning. With the municipality upgrading the weather advisory to a Level 10 warning and many of the beachfront roads underwater, the series organisers opted to postpone the second race of the popular Sunday morning series to a future date to be set in consultation with the KZN Canoe Union. Paddlers participating in the series often travel long distances from the North and South Coast and the interior of KwaZulu-Natal, and with road conditions already hazardous, the postponement was a logical decision for the series organisers. All entries taken for the second race will be carried forward to the new race date.
