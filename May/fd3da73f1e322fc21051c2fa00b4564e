This was part of the department’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solution roll-out launched at the school on Thursday, 19 May with a view to innovate teaching and learning spaces. Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu said the aim of the programme is to ensure that learners are equipped with the necessary resources in order to achieve the desired results. “The performance of learners is not solely dependent on the quality of educators but it also has to do with the resources at their disposal.The reason behind high performing schools located in towns has a lot to do with the access to ICT resources. As a department we are aiming to also uplift the rural based neglected schools with modern teaching and learning technology equipment.Today we installed interactive white boards, provided educators with laptops, installed a computer library and media centre to encourage reading for our learners. The ICT investment in this school is around R2 million. We urge learners, parents and community to ensure safety of the infrastructure as it will benefit the development of learners,” said MEC Mshengu.
