Following the devastating floods that befell KwaZulu-Natal in April, the mighty pack of good Samaritans belonging to the Lions Club of Durban North sprung into action providing much needed relief to the community and beyond. Speaking to Durban North News, the president of the North Durban Lions Club, Avril Hobbs, said from day one, the generous lions were out assisting where they can as soon as the dust settled and the destruction became evident. She said: “The first thing we did was to apply to our international association of clubs, which is called the Lions Club International Foundation. They sent us an emergency grant that is solely reserved for disasters. This enabled us to start purchasing and distributing goods to those that needed it”. International Chef, Citrum Khumalo, who knew of the incredible work that the club partakes in, partnered with the Lions to cook food for the residents Molweni Valley who were heavily affected by the floods. “We have also been sharing with the councillors of the greater Durban North area. We had our fourth delivery of a big truck filled with supplies recently. Lions from across the country contributed either money or goods to our efforts. As soon as they knew there was a need, the Lions did what needed to be done.” Hobbs added that the Lions had been able to tap into the community during this time, one that stood firm in their unity and generosity. “I was away at East London at a Lions National convention recently, and at the convention people were saying ‘I have this or I will send this, here is 10 000 Rand’. They were so incredibly generous. As our motto goes, ‘where there is a need, there is a Lion’,” Hobbs said. She added that for the Lions, the efforts made towards those affected by the floods will be an on-going one with the next phase being helping to rebuild communities as much as they can.
