Members of the Scottburgh community and KZN High Risk Tree Management, Crookes Brothers, P&G Construction and Blue Marlin Hotel recently worked together to clear out huge logs and trees that were washed down along the sea during the heavy torrential rains that caused major destruction to various beaches along the South  Coast.  Ward 15 Councillor, Shara Singh said working together as a community for one goal of making Scottburgh Beach user friendly and maintaining its natural beauty was inspiring to see. “Today was definitely a show of unity and support for Scottburgh by our local businesses and residents. My heartfelt gratitude to each of you. We appreciate usage of the tipper truck, chain saw, lifeguards and meals sponsorships that were provided as the work was under way,” said Cllr Singh.
