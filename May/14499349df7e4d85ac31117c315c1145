KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala together with the MEC of Transport,Community Safety and Liaison, Peggy Nkonyeni, recently inspected the progress made on the ongoing reconstruction of the N2 in uMgababa. The busy freeway collapsed following the torrential downpour that wreaked havoc in KwaZulu-Natal, last month. Zikalala said the damaged on the N2 in uMgababa has left alternative routes in Magabeni township bearing the burden of carrying heavy loads of traffic on a daily basis. He said: “The diversion has no doubt caused massive inconvenience to motorists and local communities alike and placed added pressure on routes that were not originally designed to carry heavy traffic loads. What may be the consequence of a disaster is that the very alternative temporary routes may be heavily affected themselves overtime”. Zikalala added that a creation of a temporary detour on the N2, which will enable a flow of traffic from the South Coast towards Durban, is underway. “We can report that in terms of the N2 in uMkomaas and uMgababa, SANRAL has commenced with temporary construction of a detour which will be within the N2 space. This will allow flow of traffic from the south to the north which has been blocked since the flood incidence. SANRAL estimates that the construction of the detour will be completed not later then Monday, 9 May. This will soon be followed by the permanent construction of the damaged roads which SANRAL will pronounce on shortly. We want to emphasise that a full construction of the N2 will be completed early next year.” Zikalala said.
