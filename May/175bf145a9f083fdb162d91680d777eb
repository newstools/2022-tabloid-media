The Inkatha Freedom Party in Ward 48, under the leadership of Councillor Jonathan Annipen, held a glamorous Mother’s Day celebration in honour of mothers in the ward.  The event was attended by more than 150 women from the areas of Greenbury, Stonebridge, Clayfield and Rockford. Cllr Annipen, said the programme was extremely successful and that he was delighted to see so many mothers in attendance, given the fact that it was Mother’s Day.  “We designed this event to celebrate the mothers within the ward. We extended invitations to senior citizen groups and other organisations in the area. We also honoured the work and efforts of mothers who have contributed to the welfare and development of our community by participating in programmes such as feeding schemes, skills development, moral generation and the like. We celebrated female leaders in this community who head organisations such as senior citizens, crime prevention groups, faith-based organisations and civil society groups.” Cllr Annipen said they also took time to acknowledge volunteers and local leaders. “A sari queen contest kept all our special guests entertained and prizes were awarded to the oldest and youngest mother present at the venue. Each lady received a gift and scrumptious meal,” he said. Cllr Annipen added that he was also elated that many mothers who didn’t have anywhere else to spend the special day found a place of happiness at this event. Sholayin Nundlall, who founded a non-profit organisation called, Hope for Us Foundation, said: “This was the first time that we’ve seen such an initiative from any political party and what is more impressive is that it was done without any motive behind it. There is no upcoming election or any such programme yet the IFP did this for the people. I was happy to see those mothers, especially the elderly ones enjoy the company of their friends and counter parts – they really had a wonderful time”.
