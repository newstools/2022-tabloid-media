Sunday, 15 May, was an action-packed day at Fernwood Soccer grounds. The air was filled with excitement as Newcastle Legends were hosting Volksrust Masters. Both teams comprised players over the age of 45 years old and these experienced stars from yesteryear did not fail to put up a show for the enthusiastic crowd. With supporters from Fairleigh, Lennoxton, Fernwood and surrounding areas, the players pushed themselves to the max. Legends approached the game with caution and were missing four regular players. Masters, on the other hand, started the game in search of an early goal, however, Moulana Basha, Ronnie Naicker and Ronnie Govender were solid in the Legends’ defence. Midway through the first half, Legends goalkeeper, Shani Balraj, was robbed of the ball by the Masters striker who slotted the ball into the net. Masters pegged Legends back with Legends struggling to get out of their own half. Vincent Muthoo and Premie Singh of Legends tried to control the game but Masters were too classy. The introduction of Solly Maharaj saw Legends get some composure. In the second half, Legends started to push numbers forward to get the equaliser. Masters caught Legends on the counter attack and got a second goal. Mushin Mandla and Patrick Vere tried to get Legends back in the game but to no avail. With time running out, Legends striker, Akesh Dawlall, had a great chance to get a goal back but his thunderous strike was well saved by the Masters goalkeeper. Volksrust Masters ran out 2-nil victors over Newcastle Legends. In the Newcastle Social Soccer League, SACC UTD took on the young Spartans in a very tense game.
