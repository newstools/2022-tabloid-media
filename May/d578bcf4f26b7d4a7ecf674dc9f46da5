The appointment of Chatsworth’s Jason Sathiaseelan as Chief Executive Officer is another important step in the process of KZN Inland becoming an independent affiliate of Cricket South Africa following seven years of stewardship under the KwaZulu-Natal Cricket Union. In February this year, KZNI hosted their inaugural Annual General Meeting where a board was elected with Shaun van der Byl as the president. At the meeting, it was also agreed that KZNI will operate as an Affiliate of the KZNCU until the CSA Member’s Council approves CSA affiliation status. Further to their success on the field with the CSA One Day Cup Division Two trophy residing at the Pietermaritzburg Oval, Inland’s biggest improvement came off the field with Inland teaming up successfully under the banner of the KZNCU to improve holistically and move up ten places on the CSA Scorecard to finish in the number one position and gain the title of the best affiliate in South Africa. These successes meant that many of the preliminary boxes could be ticked, and the focus could shift to the governance and the important matter of finding the right CEO to follow up on the important work done by KZNCU CEO, Heinrich Strydom and his team. Newly elected KZN Inland President, Shaun van der Byl, believes that through his experience, Sathiaseelan will move KZNI in the right direction. “Jason is the right person to take KZNI forward as he has been the Cricket Services Manager since 2017 and has been an integral part of Inland Cricket,” he said. Sathiaseelan is excited by what lies ahead as he prepares to move the union forward. “This is a big moment in the history of Inland cricket as we start to operate independently again. I would like to thank Inland President Shaun van der Byl and the Inland board for entrusting me with this important responsibility and I am looking forward to the challenge ahead,” Sathiaseelan said.
