Gunn said being a mother means you are a super woman, in good and difficult times. “My daughters look up to me and think I have super powers. From doing school runs to making sure there is enough to eat and being there for them even at my weakest point and just being with them; it all makes me look forward to each day,” said Gunn. She said she remembers asking her mom, in her younger years, what she thought the meaning of life was. “My mom used to say: ‘You will figure that out when you become a mother one day’. The day I became a mom, I realised what she meant. My true meaning of life is my daughters, Emma and Kate,” said Gunn. The Springfield Weekly Gazette management and staff wish all the mothers, grandmothers and mother figures in our lives a happy and blessed Mother’s Day for Sunday, 8 May.
