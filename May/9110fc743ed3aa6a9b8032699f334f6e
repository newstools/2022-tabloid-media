A resident of Fairbreeze, Tongaat, was seriously injured after he was allegedly stabbed and assaulted by his former tenant and three other males who arrived at his premises on Friday afternoon. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were called out to a neighbours property where the victim sought refuge following the attack. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram said the victim informed members that his former tenant, who was evicted from his property weeks ago, arrived at his residence with three other males. “They were under the influence of alcohol. The four men began assaulting the homeowner. He was also stabbed on his leg before they used a hammer to smash the window on his bakkie.” Balram said the man informed officers that he attempted to fight off his attackers but they overpowered him. “He managed to break free and fled to a neighbours house where he sought refuge. Reaction Officers proceeded to his residence in search of the suspects however they had fled. The victim was transported to a medical facility and stated that he would register a criminal case against his attackers once discharged.”
