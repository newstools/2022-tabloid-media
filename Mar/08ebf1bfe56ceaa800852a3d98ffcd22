In celebration of their years of selfless commitment to serving those less fortunate, Food For Life Africa River Range Ranch (FFLA-RRR) held a day of celebration on Sunday, 6 March, where they reminisced about the challenges and joys that came in the long journey of their success.  A very proud co-chairperson of FFLA River Range, Ray Ramlall, said with their 10 branches of FFLA they have collectively prepared six million plates of food throughout the country. He said: “This is an amazing achievement and one we can be proud of. Assisting the needy is a passion and it never ends. There are millions in this country who go to bed without supper. Families who live in abject poverty and don’t know where their next meal is coming from. We aim to ease that burden as much as our resources allow”. Ramlall said the event was held as an awareness and a celebration that in under two years, despite the challenges of the pandemic and unrest FFLA, still had its kitchens opened and prepared over four million meals and continued feeding through all groups in society. Present at the event was a number of high profile dignitaries including the Swaroop Dramodar Das, Shamim Rajbansi and Kamal Panday, who were all delighted to learn of the work done by FFLA River Range. “Being able to raise the funds to consistently prepare almost 165 000 plates of freshly prepared meals on a monthly basis to meet the needs of the hungry is no easy feat. FFLA meals distribution and humanitarian service was promoted and guided by the teachings of our spiritual master Srila Prapuda, the founder of The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). No person shall be hungry within a radius of 10 miles in your area. Therefore  FFLA is opening more kitchens through this beautiful society,” Ramlall said. He also extended that his gratitude to Vick and Helena Panday for providing FFLA with a kitchen and filling the greatest humanitarian service.
