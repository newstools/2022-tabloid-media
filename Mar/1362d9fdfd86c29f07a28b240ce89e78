The principal of Greenvale Primary School, Anil Singh recently joined hands with the director of Izinkanyezi Training and Development (PTY) Ltd, Linda Chettiar to provide learners from Grades RR to 7 with interactive lessons comprising of a combination of coding, robotics, abacus math and chess. Chettiar said that with a strong background in Information and Communications Technology, Continuing Professional Teacher Development and leadership skills, she felt the desire to channel these skills to the youth. “Learning these skills will not only harness a child’s potential to make wise career choices but will also enable them to use higher order thinking skills for sound decision making skills of which visionary leaders are made of.  A visionary leader can foresee the future, knows how to strategically position people and builds the future for generations to come,” she said. Chettiar said the combination of Coding, Robotics, Abacus Math and Chess while supporting science, technology, STEM initiatives will certainly open doors into the fields of artificial intelligence, data and machine learning, nanotechnology, programming, software and application development. “It further gears one in acquiring leadership skills such as logical, creative, critical, analytical, strategic, reflective and forward thinking. It also improves communication, cooperation and collaboration skills, problem-solving and decision-making skills and ultimately teamwork,” she said. Learners are encouraged to attend the lessons on Saturdays at Greenvale Primary School. For more information call 083-234-7019.
