Miss South Africa 2021,  24-year-old Lalela Mswane, recently launched her #BeReady advocacy campaign, a programme aimed at helping budding entrepreneurs learn how to become employers rather than job seekers. Mswane is set to host a monthly edutainment series where she will invite those keen on starting their own businesses to join her online sessions on how to go about it – successfully. Alongside experts in all areas of business, the series sets out to provide information and tips on how to get a start-up off the ground. Coupled with this, Mswane will, at the same time, embark on her own entrepreneurial venture, an online clothing company with positiviTees at its core. Showcasing the pitfalls and successes shared by experts and the public, Mswane hopes to ultimately have her own successful and profitable business. “I am starting my own company, I will start with t-shirts that will feature inspirational messages. I am hoping that people will join me as I learn the rudimentary basics of how to start a business. From the first stage, we will all be learning together,” shared Mswane.  As she embarks on this foray into the world of commerce, Mswane will, through industry experts, provide information and tips on how to stay afloat and maintain sustainable growth. “The Bureau of Labour Statistics reports that 20% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open. A further 45% fail during the first five years and an astonishing 65% during the first 10 years.” Monthly topics will include: How to draw up a business plan, get and maintain compliance, learn how to market yourself, where to get funding and how to scale your business. These sessions will be available on Mswane’s social platforms as well as the Official Miss South Africa platform.
