Sixteen year-old, Courtney Jead Deepchand, who is a passionate model, is making her name known after being chosen to represent the community of Phoenix at the Face of SA High School modelling pageant. The Grade 11 Daleview Secondary learner, said she wants to pursue a career in nursing after school, but has a strong passion for modeling. She said: “I started my modeling journey two years ago because I wanted to build my self confidence after being bullied at school, myself confidence had taken a back seat. The most existing part was taking on the ramp for the first time at the age of 14 and having the crowd cheer me on was a really proud moment, my other special moment was launching my own closet as a fashion designer at a ZE Models International fashion show at the age of 16”. She shared that being chosen to represent the community of Phoenix on a national level is an esteemed moment in her modeling career. “I didn’t expect to be chosen, however, I had a dream of winning a national title and I saw this as a stepping stone towards my model career successes,” she said. Apart from modeling Deepchand enjoys dancing, swimming and being a spontaneous foodie. “A big thanks to my mom for being my strength and inspiration through my journey and special thanks to my model coach, Zakiah Ebrahim of ZE Models Intrrnational, for her guidance and mentorship throughout my model journey. To my friends family well wishers and fans I’m so grateful for all of you.” Deepchand said that she wants to reach the level of achieving Miss Universe title, one day. Ebrahim said: “Courtney has flourished in her modeling since the day that I started coaching her. She has made me and my brand extremely proud, every step of the way. This selection did not come as a surprise to me. “On behalf of ZE models international and our sister brand FQTV we extend congratulations and celebrations to Courtney. We are rooting for your win and we confident you will be bringing the title home”.
