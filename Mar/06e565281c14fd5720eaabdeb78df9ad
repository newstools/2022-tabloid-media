This auspicious month is also seen as a commemoration of the first revelation of the Qur’an from God to the Prophet (Peace be upon him).  In Ramadan Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset and immerse themselves in additional night prayers known as ‘Taraweeh’. This prayer includes the recitation and completion of the entire Qur’an in congregation over 29 nights. The month-long fast ends with the sighting of the new moon for the month of Shawaal, signifying Eid-ul-Fitr. This is a day of rejoicing and family get togethers after the fast. In Ramadan, aside from not only abstaining from eating or drinking, fasting is seen as a cleansing process where worshippers abstain from worldly pleasure and increase their charitable contributions. Ready for Ramadan are siblings Ahmed, Aaliyah and Sumayya Vahed displaying dates, or khajoor, that is traditionally eaten when one opens, or ‘breaks’ the day-long fast or ‘roza’. Opening the fast with a date was among the practices of the Prophet of Islam. The editor, management and staff of Tabloid Newspapers wish all Muslims a peaceful and spiritually fulfilling Ramadan.
