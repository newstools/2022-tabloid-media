As the Chalupsky Properties Marine Surfski Series moved into the business end of the seven-race schedule, Umhlanga’s Matt Bouman signalled his intentions to fight for the series title by grabbing a second series win in big swell conditions on Friday night. The Funky Pants Challenge saw Bouman use his strength and skills in the large surf and offshore swell conditions to pull away from current series leader and his protégée Gene Prato, throwing the race for the series wide open as it heads into its final two races. Prato had to be content to watch his coach race into the beach finish at Marine SLC through the big surf whipped up by the weather system bearing down on Durban this weekend, handing the veteran Bouman his second win of the series. Matthew Coetzer, fresh from his second place in the junior race at the MyLife Dusi Canoe Marathon excelled by taking the last place on the overall podium. The women’s race saw Saskia Hockly mark her return from illness by winning the women’s race comfortably against a small field. The win sees Hockly move into full control of the women series standings, particularly as series defending champion Michelle Burn has dropped out of all paddling as she deals with a serious shoulder injury picked up in the N3TC Drak Challenge last month. Gary Behn and partner Gavin Dundas-Starr won the doubles long course race going away from Gavin Botha and Gareth Miles, with the father-and-son combination of Colin Simpkins and new Dusi junior champ Josh Simpkins wrapped up third place. The race had a distinct family feel as sponsors Funky Pants handed out paddling shorts to every son or daughter completing a fourth race with their parent in the Ballies n Babes/Dads n Lads promotion. The sixth race of the series is on Friday 4 March 2022.
