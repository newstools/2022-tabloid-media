Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, has called on police to cast their net wide in search of the stepfather who killed siblings in Ulundi, Northern KZN, recently. It is alleged that the deceased, 12-year-old Asimbonge Mbalenhle Shongwe, and her seven-year-old sister, Sandakahle Sharon Manana, were kidnapped by their stepfather on 3 March. On the following day, Sandakahle’s body was found with severe injuries and strangulation marks. Asimbonge’s body was discovered on Sunday, 6 March. The bodies were found in separate places. MEC Khoza has sent her heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased children, neighbours and educators of the schools they were attending. “It is very painful that we continue to count bodies of innocent children being murdered by heartless individuals in our province. It is really shocking and despicable that an old person can target defenceless children and kill them. That person did not even listen to the pleas and cries for mercy from the children,” she said. MEC Khoza has encouraged law enforcement agencies to do their best to catch the alleged perpetrator. “Although we know that the alleged perpetrator would not return the lives of these children, the police will have to find him to pay for his sins. It is very painful that we are living in a country where the lives of humans are taken lightly. Killing an innocent child because of disputes between adults is no solution,” she said. MEC Khoza added that she had much confidence that a team of dedicated investigators would track down the heartless killer to ensure that the justice system can hand down an appropriate sentence and has also dispatched a team of social workers to visit the bereaved family and provide psych-social support. The team is expected to spend more time with the family to help them deal with the impact of the incident.
