The 2022 DJ regularity rally for pre-war and classic vintage motorcycles will take competitors from Durban to Johannesburg on 11 and 12 March and will be stopping over in Ladysmith on Friday, 11 March.   “The competitors will be stopping to refuel in Ladysmith at around 1.30pm at Total filling station and members of the public are welcome to catch a glimpse of these classic pre-war vintage motorcycles,” said Clerk of the course, Hylton Allison.  Allison added that 16 first-time racers will be among the 105 competitors. Among the bikes, the oldest will be a 1918 Harley Davidson, three 1920 ABC’s and a 1922 BA.   “We are extremely excited about the timed rally and can’t wait to get back into getting this yearly event started.” Allison said that with Covid-19 regulations, the rally had to take a hiatus. “We are working hard to make this year’s rally great for our first-comers so that they can make their way back for next year.” Ladysmith motorbike enthusiasts can also catch up with Trevor Binder and his two MotoGP racer sons, Brad and Darryn, who will be among the bikers. Brad Binder has won two MotoGP titles and Darryn will be taking part in his first MotoGP. The first motorcycle race was held in 1913 and initial races were from Johannesburg to Durban over a three-day period with stopovers in Standerton and Ladysmith. In 1919, the race moved to a two-day event and has remained as such to this day with a stopover in Newcastle. 1922 saw the event change cities and has been held from Durban to Johannesburg since.  The event will start at 6am on Friday, 11 March, from Hillcrest Corner Shopping Mall, KZN, and will travel a pre-determined route along the R103 and N11 to Newcastle for an overnight stop. The journey will commence again on Saturday, 12 March, at 6am, leaving Newcastle.
