The colours of the South African flag were flying high, all day yesterday, as the rainbow nation celebrated Human Rights Day in remembrance of the Sharpeville Massacre, where 69 people died and 180 others were wounded, when police fired on a peaceful crowd that had gathered in protest against the Apartheid pass laws, on 21 March 1960. In honour of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight for freedom for all, Stonebridge Primary School hosted a fun day in commemoration of Human Rights Day. The learners were treated to a day of fun and games, while celebrating their right to education. The Acting Principal of Stonebridge Primary School, Mrs L Govender, said the learners were treated to a sumptuous treat and enjoyed playing on the jumping castle. She said: “They designed beautiful hats which showed off their colouring skills and were displayed along the corridors. Parents assisted with sponsorship and on site. The funds that were raised will be used to improve safety and security at the school”. Govender said it is extremely important to secure the school environment to ensure the safety of the learners and educators. “Thanks and appreciation goes to all who assisted, including department head and convenor, Ms Merhoye, foundation phase educators, Mrs Moodley, Mrs Tikachand, Mrs T Govender, as well as staff educator assistants and kind parents, who made the day exciting for the learners” said Govender.
