South African oil company Engen has stepped up to support Mason Lincoln Special School, an Umlazi-based school which caters for physically challenged, visually impaired, autistic, intellectually impaired (mild), epileptic learners, and learners with albinism.  Engen’s donation includes a specialist ultrasound machine and TheraBand exercise stability balls that will provide learners with access to specialist physiotherapy and crucial rehabilitation.  The official handover over of the equipment, as well as stationery packs for 330 learners, took place on 15 March 2022.  Principal Happy B. Shoba-Morolong says Mason Lincoln Special School is extremely grateful to Engen for their generous contribution because physiotherapy is an integral part of our learner’s rehabilitation.  “Accessing an ultrasound machine has been at the top of our wish list for a long time.Ultrasound is used for regeneration and cellular repair of acute ailments and long-term injuries and also helps with pain management and arthritis and will benefit 1 in 3 of our learners,” said Principal Shoba-Morolong.  For Engen, disability inclusion is one of the company’s key social investment focus areas, giving South Africa’s favourite* petrol station brand an opportunity to contribute towards inclusive rights in South Africa.  “As a caring and inclusive company with ‘heart’, this aligns with Engen’s commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which endeavour to ensure a better and more sustainable future for all,” said Dr James Nyawera, Engen’s head of Transformation and Stakeholder Engagement. Founded in 1943, Mason Lincoln Special School caters to learners with physical and intellectual disabilities from Grades R to 12.  “Our mission is to make a difference in the lives of learners with disabilities as well as disabled people in the community at large,” said Shoba-Morolong.  For more information about the school visit http://masonlincolnschool.co.za
