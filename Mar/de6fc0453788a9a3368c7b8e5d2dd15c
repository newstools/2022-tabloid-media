As the holy month of Ramadaan approaches, Muslims all over the world will be searching the skies for the crescent moon, which is expected to show on 2 April, marking the beginning of the fasting period. Siblings, five-year-old Hafsa and four-year-old Hamza Haffeejee, will be observing the Ladysmith skies in anticipation of this auspicious occasion. “Both understand the importance of the fasting period and are always eager to show support and love to me and dad. There is so much we can be grateful for,” said Fateema Haffeejee, mother of the siblings. The ninth month in the Islamic calendar is a month of sacrifice, fasting, prayers and reflection for the Muslim community. The end of the fasting period, according to the Islamic calendar, is expected to be on 1 May. The Ladysmith Herald management and staff would like to wish all our Muslim advertisers and readers a blessed Ramadaan.
