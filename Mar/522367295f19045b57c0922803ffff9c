The Merebank Clinic is raising awareness on Tuberculosis (TB) and are encouraging the community to get tested during TB Awareness Month, in March. Manager of Merebank Clinic, Nomfundo Chonco said that they are encouraging people to get screened for TB because it is a killer disease. “With the Department of Health we have something called awareness calender and March was set aside for TB awareness. We are inviting people to come in and get tested for TB,” she said. Community activist and member of FOSA, Sharin Rajmin said days like World TB Day should be used to highlight the chronic sickness. “People need not to be stigmatised by the word TB. They should take precaution as its a highly contagious disease. “During the month of March, all clinics in the Municipality will be focusing on TB and provide free treatment. If you have any symptoms which include  coughing and chest pains, you need to get tested because you will never know if you are a carrier. It could be detrimental to your family, community and especially yourself,” she said. Some of the symptoms of TB are coughing for more than two weeks, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, chest pain and coughing up blood. “TB can be cured if you complete your treatment. Treatment is free. You can prevent TB by covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Keep windows open in your home. Sunlight kills TB germs and the fresh air blows them away,” said Chonco.
