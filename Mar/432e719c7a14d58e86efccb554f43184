Snake rescuer, Nick Evans rescued a 2.5 metre black mamba under an old freezer which was not in use in Westville North on Sunday, 20 March. Evans said this was the biggest mamba of the three calls that came in on Sunday. “When I arrived, I looked around the freezer, and couldn’t see anything, but there was an obvious space underneath. I had to flip the freezer over to get a look. As I did so, I was momentarily surprised, and very disappointed, to find there was no mamba, only to see it had actually gone in the freezer, around the compressor.  It was an interesting sight really. The mamba was massive. I think it thought it was safe in there. I let it be, while I figured out which space I’d extract it from. I soon made a decision on how to extract it. I tried grabbing the body through the biggest gap available, with the tongs, but of course, the mamba didn’t like that at all. It started getting agitated, moving around a lot. My plan wasn’t working,” he said. Evans added that the snake wanted to come out and poked its head out, and he gently clamped it down with the tongs. “It lunged itself forward in a panic, but I held on firmly, but again, as gentle as possible. When I got the tongs into a stable position, I reached for the head with my hand. This mamba had a big head. Although, as I saw when the rest of the body came out, the body was big too. A well-fed 2.5 metre female. She wasn’t happy, but, removing her from a property occupied by a few people and a few dogs, was definitely for the best.” Evans also thanked residents who assisted with the rescuing of the black mamba.
