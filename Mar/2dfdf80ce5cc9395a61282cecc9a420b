EThekwini Municipality spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said the Durban Solid Waste (DSW) driver who was filmed allegedly drinking in a municipal vehicle with his ‘friends’ in Amanzimtoti beach recently will be charged for misconduct and bringing the city into disrepute.  The driver and other people were filmed in a video which went viral on social media having a ‘jolly good time’ with open alcohol bottles in a branded municipal vehicle on Monday, 21 March. “The City has been made aware of the disturbing footage and condemns this unfortunate incident with the contempt it deserves. As a result, the driver of the vehicle is going to be charged for misconduct and for putting the city into disrepute. The City appeals to anyone witnessing behaviour of this nature to alert the organization immediately. Municipal vehicles should only be used to help the city to discharge its basic responsibilities to the benefit of all its stakeholders”, said Mayisela. This is not the first incident where an allegedly intoxicated municipal driver has been caught ‘red handed’ on video, misusing state resources. In a separate but related incident, an allegedly intoxicated eThekwini municipal worker, who was also caught on video, was arrested last year when he crashed through an entrance at Galleria Mall and drove through the mall while attempting to find parking. Such incidents have angered residents, with many condemning the misuse of state resources. Speaking to the South Coast Weekly Gazette, resident, Rishi Sewsunker condemned the incident and said such incidents linger in the mind of residents whose cries fall into deaf ears when they require basic services like refuse dump collections. “Clearly stricter measures should be implemented against officials who misuse state resources,” he said. Residents can contact 0800-20-2020 to report such incidents to the eThekwini Municipality.
