This comes after a learner at the school was found in possession of Xanax and dagga. It is alleged that several learners bought the anti-depressant drug and began to feel unwell soon after consuming it while other female learners were offered a cool-drink laced with the drug. The parents allege that the matter was swept under the carpet and that they were told to keep it discreet, when they approached the school for answers. According to reports two learners were involved in the peddling, however, only one was found in possession of the drugs when police attended to the complaint. A parent who did not want to be named said: “I was part of the group of parents who went to the school to get answers. While waiting to speak to the principal, and were discussing the matter among ourselves, a teacher came out and told us to keep quiet and keep the matter discreet until we speak to the principal. Why do they want us to keep it discreet when this is such a serious issue and our children were victims, and given drugs without their knowledge. As a result, the girls were so high that they weren’t aware about what was happening around them.”  She said upon speaking to the principal, they were informed that the school was going to get SAPS involved. The parent further stated: “As we left the principal’s office, we received information about two girls who had just bought the Xanax drugs from the peddler. We immediately approached the chairman of the school governing body who went to the classroom where the pills were being sold, accompanied by the principal and a teacher. They found the learner with Xanax pills and that’s when the police were called to come in”. Another irate parent who spoke on the basis of anonymity said: “This behaviour is unacceptable, we send our children to school to learn and get an education but get there and are put in harmful situations by other learners. It is concerning that there are learners who go to school to enrich themselves and their suppliers while causing grievous bodily harm to other learners. They sit in classes high on Xanax mixtures and dagga which defeats the purpose of the school as a learning institution. If we do not put a stop to this now, it will continue and innocent children will become victims or end up getting raped. Criminal action must be taken against learners found with incriminating substances in schools.” Ward 48 Councillor Michelle Lutchmen who was approached by concerned parents said: “What transpired at the school is very disturbing. I was very concerned after several parents contacted me about the incident and immediately contacted the Department of Education to deal with the allegations. We must ensure that our children are not exposed to any form of drugs in or outside of school premises. We also call on parents to play a pivotal role and monitor their kids to ensure that they are not exposed to any form of substance abuse.” Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid, the Chairperson for the KZN Parents Association, Vee Gani, said: “What is happening in schools is totally unacceptable. Schools are institutions of learning and teaching and any person who is under the influence of drugs, selling or distributing drugs in a school, is committing a criminal offense and needs to be handled by the authorities. Calling for more police visibility is not the remedy, it might be a slight deterrent but police are not in schools the whole day. Parents need to take the responsibility for their children to ensure that they are not indulging in any unlawful activities.” “Schools on the other hand have the responsibility to inform the police and ensure that criminal charges are applied. Schools must not hesitate to prosecute any child that is found guilty,” added Gani. Comment form the Department of Education was not forthcoming at the time of going to print.
