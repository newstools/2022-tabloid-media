Let’s save  our oceans  from hazardous  items which can cause  harm to our fish… Community based organisations, ACCS Ubuntu Foundation and Faith Football Club recently joined forces and embarked on  cleaning up uMhlanga Beach on Saturday, 12 March. Approximately 20 men, women and children representing Faith FC and ACCS Ubuntu Foundation, participated in this community project. The group displayed great enthusiasm and teamwork and were determined to fulfil their social responsibility, despite the scotching heat. Ronald Ramulu from Faith FC said the beach-goers, that were present, were pleasantly surprised and that the feedback was very positive from the community, who applauded the group for saving the environment. “It is important to involve our kids in projects of this nature, as it teaches them a sense of responsibility towards our environment. In the end, the message was clear, let’s save our oceans,” he added. The organiser of the beach clean-up project, Shanice Sydney, said: “ACCS Ubuntu Foundation is a company based in uMhlanga that simply wanted to give back to the community by embarking on a clean-up project, to keep our beaches from hazardous items which can cause harm to our fish. We have partnered with Faith Football Club in the past and we were very excited to bring them on board in our latest venture.” The organisations urged members of the community to refrain from littering on the beaches and make use of the bins provided to dispose off their litter.
