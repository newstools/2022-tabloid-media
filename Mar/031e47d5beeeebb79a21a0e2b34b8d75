Following the sell-out success of this heart-warming family show last year, Kickstart Theatre Co returns this coming holiday season, with their charming production of Charlotte’s Web, featuring the original cast, and presented once again, in the lush and leafy Botanic Gardens Amphitheatre. This theatrical adaptation of the evergreen children’s classic by E.B.White, tells the story of Wilbur, a cute, plucky piglet, who is rescued and hand-raised by a little girl named Fern. When Wilbur is sent to live on the Zuckerman’s farm in a barn full of delightful animal characters, he be-friends a spider named Charlotte, who must use all her cunning to outwit the local farming community and save Wilbur’s life! Presented on a colourful set, nestled in the tranquil Botanic Gardens setting, with a marvellous mix of puppets, theatrical magic, and a cast of well-loved KZN actors, this play for young audiences is the perfect holiday treat for all ages. The shady Amphitheatre is ideal for picnics and will be open for seating one hour prior to each performance. Audiences are invited to pack their own refreshments, bring their picnic blankets and cushions and arrive early for a fun outdoor picnic-theatre experience. Considered a classic in children’s literature and enjoyed by adults as well as children, in 2000 Publishers Weekly listed it as the bestselling children’s paperback of all time!  The story was apparently inspired by White’s encounter with a real pig which he attempted to save.  He also met a real spider, whom he called Charlotte Epeira, who was immortalised as the heroine of his novel. Tickets can be booked via Webtickets.
