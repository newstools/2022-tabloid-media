Roads in parts of Ladysmith CBD were closed to traffic due to localised flooding this morning, 15 March.  Heavy downpours were recorded last night and early this morning which caused severe flooding, particularly in Lyell, Alexandra, Queen and King streets where water levels reached knee-height, resulting in a few retailers having to clear out stock from their shops.  Alfred Duma Municipality Public Safety officials were placed at the flooded streets and motorists had to seek alternative routes to work and school. Officials told The Ladysmith Herald that the water levels are slowly rising, but at this stage it is not yet a serious concern. The water level reading at the Soofie bridge was at 6.9m and 7.7m at the Quedusizi Dam. Officials said they are closely monitoring the situation.  This is the second time this year that the Ladysmith CBD area has been flooded and in January, people had to be evacuated from their homes due to the severity of the flooding. Businesses in and around the area are still blaming the municipality for not cleaning and maintaining the stormwater drains.
