Vintage motorcycle enthusiast, Mark Davis, helps Usayb Arbee get a closer look at the 1932 BAC classic motorcycle during a refuelling stop-over in Ladysmith on Friday. Davis joined over 110 other motorcyclists in the two-day 2022 DJ Regularity Rally when competitors started the first leg of the timed race in Durban and stopped over in Ladysmith before continuing to Newcastle with the race ending in Johannesburg.   Ladysmith streets recently roared with the arrival of this year’s 2022 DJ Regularity Rally for pre-war, classic and vintage motorcycles in the 109th race, with over 110 competitors making a quick stop-over to refuel on Friday, 11 March.  Local motorcycle lovers were in for a few classic treats as they watched these metal marvels make their way into Ladysmith.  Sixteen first-time racers were among those racing against the clock, with the oldest being a 1918 Harley Davidson. Joining the classic ranks were three 1920 ABCs and a 1922 BA.  “I had to ask dad to bring me. Never in my life did I think that bikes looked like this,” said Usayb Arbee, who was invited by Mark Davis to take a closer look at his motorbike. Competitors told The Ladysmith Herald that they had a few breakdowns along the way, but the trip and the race against time were still worth it. Our only problem is that the roads heading here are really not in a good state, so we had to make sure that extra attention was given to miss a few large holes in the roads.”   MotoGP racer, Darryn Binder, said that he is having the time of his life as he shared this first-time experience with his father and older brother. “It’s just great and I’m really enjoying the ride along these parts,” said Binder.  The riders said they still had a long way to go and with tanks filled and a quick break, engines roared to life once again as they made their way towards the N11, heading for Newcastle to spend the night before continuing their journey.
