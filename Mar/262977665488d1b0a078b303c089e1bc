Muslims will be scanning the skies this week Friday in hopes of viewing the new moon which will mark the end of the month of Shabaan and the beginning of the month of Ramadaan. Ramadaan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is the holiest month for Muslims. Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid, High Priest of Aleemia Masjid in Phoenix, Moulana Mohammed Tariq said that fasting during the month of Ramadaan is one of the five pillars of Islam. “It is during this month that the holy Quran – the holy book of the Muslims was revealed to mankind through Angel Gabriel to the Prophet. During this month, Muslims not only refrain from eating or drinking during the day but recite the holy Quran more frequently. In addition to the five daily prayers, the taraweeh prayer is also offered which is a prayer in which the entire Quran is recited at night, during the month. During the sacred prayer, Muslims bow their head in complete submission to God the Almighty, seeking his guidance and forgiveness,” said Moulana Tariq. “Fasting during the holy month of Ramadaan teaches us to control the use of our senses, mind and body, to practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice and empathy for those who are less fortunate. Muslims realise the suffering, needs and feelings of those who are destitute. Charitable acts of all kinds are encouraged during the holy month,” said Moulana Tariq. “During this holy month, we are given an opportunity to reconnect with our religion and consider how our everyday lives reflect our faith. It’s a very transformative time as we turn to our faith to help us become better people and strengthen our relationships with each other,” added Moulana Tariq. The management and staff of Tabloid Newspapers take this opportunity in wishing all Muslims Ramadaan Mubarak.
