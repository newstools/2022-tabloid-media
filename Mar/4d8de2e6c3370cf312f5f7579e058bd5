A man, believed to be in his 50s, is fighting for his life after he was shot in the head when he took on the role of a Good Samaritan and rushed to his neighbour’s assistance during a hijacking incident, on Inwabi Road in Isipingo, south of Durban, a short while ago. Law enforcement, security personnel and emergency services rushed to the scene of the shooting and found the victim critically injured. PT Alarms spokesperson, Dhevan Govindasamy said: “PT Alarms Tactical, Response and Ambulance Service responded to the scene and found emergency services, security personnel, Metro Police and SAPS also in attendance. The suspects fled with the vehicle, reported to be a Toyota bakkie.” “It is alleged that a female had dropped off her husband at work and returned home when the hijackers struck. The woman screamed and the victim, a neighbour, rushed to her assistance. The hijackers fired at the victim striking him on the head/temple. The hijackers fled with the vehicle,” Govindasamy added. Emer-G-Med spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen, said: “Several advanced life support interventions were needed to stabilize the victim before he was placed onto a mechanical ventilator to assist him in breathing. The call was then made for the assistance of the Netcare911 aeromedical helicopter to airlift him through to a specialist facility for the definitive care that he required.”
