International celebrity, actor Tom Cruise, landed at Ladysmith Airfield this morning, 28 March. The Mission Impossible actor is in South Africa filming his latest instalment of the action franchise.  With his mask on, he left a parked trailer that had been waiting for him on the airfield and walked towards the waiting helicopters as he greeted a few of the locals who had gathered at the airfield, waving before doing a spot check on his chopper and getting in. He and his filming crew spent a short time in Ladysmith before flying off to central Drakensberg to continue shooting the movie.  Cruise was very friendly and waved at onlookers before heading off towards the Berg. “It was such a pleasant way to start a Monday morning, to think he stopped in Ladysmith,” said one of locals who managed to catch a quick glimpse of the actor.
