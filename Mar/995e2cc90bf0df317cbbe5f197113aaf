Muslims around the world are preparing to begin their month-long fast of Ramadan on Saturday 2 April, which is considered to be the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. Ramadan is the ninth month in the Muslim lunar calendar and Muslims observe this sacred month to mark when God sent an angel to the Prophet to reveal the Quran, the Islamic holy book, in 610 AD. A trio of Chatsworth cousins are eager to begin their fast. Siblings Zoya and Zenae Abadeen and their cousin Mohammed Waseem Sheik said that it was an exciting time for them. From their understanding, the fast requires them to fast from sunrise to sunset and depending on the sighting of the moon, they will get to celebrate the culmination of the month-long fast on 2 May. This celebration is known as Eid Ul Fitr. The holy month of Ramadan takes Muslims on a spiritual journey to make their way closer to the Almighty. The management and staff of the Chatsworth Tabloid would like to wish advertisers and readers a blessed Ramadan Mubarak.
