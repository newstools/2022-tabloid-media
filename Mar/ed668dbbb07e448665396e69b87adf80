Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, said the suspect was arrested after the fatal stabbing incident. She said: “It is alleged by a witness (the neighbour) that at about 7pm he was outside his flat talking with the suspect when the suspect’s girlfriend approached to hand him a plate of food. The girlfriend then allegedly informed the suspect that she was ending their relationship and stated that she never wants to see him (suspect) again. The victim turned and went inside the house and the suspect followed her”. “The witness alleged that a few minutes later he heard the victim screaming his name (the neighbour) and as he went to investigate, he saw the boyfriend with a knife in his right hand stabbing the girlfriend multiple times on her body. He grabbed the suspect to prevent him from continuously stabbing the victim at which point the suspect then tried to stab him too, before fleeing the scene,” Cpt Naidoo added. The victim was taken to Mount Edgecombe Hospital for medical treatment and a state case was opened for attempted murder. Phoenix Community Police Forum chairperson, Umesh Singh, said: “Community members need to practice tolerance and live in peace. By reacting in such gross violence, the woman’s life could have easily been snuffed out. We have yet another gender based violence (GBV) victim and statistic to add to the escalating numbers. There needs to be proper and mature communication between partners to avoid such brutal violence. The law must be enforced effectively to send a strong message to GBV perpetrators that they will be punished for their actions”.
