This was confirmed by the provincial SAPS Spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala, in a statement released on Sunday, 6 March, stating that the businessman’s wife made a complaint with Westville SAPS after her husband did not come home on Friday, 4 March. “The complainant said that on 4 March at 10.30pm, her husband did not arrive home and when she phoned him, she sensed that he was in trouble. The complainant said when she tried calling again, the phone was taken from him by an unknown male who demanded a ransom of R1 million so that the victim will be released,” said Lt Col Gwala. She said charges of kidnapping and extortion were opened for investigation at Westville SAPS and a task team was activated by the station commander to search for the victim and the suspects. “Police were later informed that the victim managed to escape and made his way to Taylors Halt SAPS outside Pietermaritzburg. The businessman was later reunited with his family,” said Lt Col Gwala. She added that after following up on information received, it was established that the businessman was held at a house at KwaDindi in Taylors Halt. “Two suspects, aged 27 and 32, were placed under arrest after they were found in possession of two firearms and ammunition. During the police investigation, it was also established that the victim was kidnapped from his business premises in Reservoir Hills and cash was taken by the suspects from the premises. While he was held captive, the suspects withdrew more cash from his credit card.” Lt Col Gwala said the suspects appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on charges of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, kidnapping and extortion. The case was remanded to 15 March.
