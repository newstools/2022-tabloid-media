Three suspects briefly appeared in the Dundee Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 7 March, for the murder of 24-year-old stay-at-home mother of two, Mercisha Tedpaul. The three – Sanjoth Madhan, 28, Sarika Madhan, 47, and Manoj Madhan, 58 – will remain in police custody until their bail application later this month. “On 4 March, Dundee Police recovered the body of a 24-year-old missing woman at Watt Road in Dundee. It is alleged that the victim was strangled to death by the three suspects,” said KZN Police Spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Tedpaul was reported missing by family on 1 March when she did not return home. She had left her two daughters with her boyfriend at the time she had gone missing. Family and friends are riddled with shock and are struggling to come to terms with the death. They described Tedpaul as a ‘God-fearing’ mother who only wanted the best for her children and have, since the tragedy, started a Facebook page called ‘Justice for Mercisha Tedpaul’. Col Mbele said that the motive of the killing is unknown and that police are continuing their investigation.
