High-energy Durban comedy couple powerhouse, Aaron Mcilroy and Lisa Bobbert, presents a fabulous fun frolic, Go Big, at Seabrooke’s Theatre at Durban High School until 13 March.               If there was ever a time when laughter was needed it is now and this husband and wife team deliver to the max in this side splitting new production. Deftly directed and choreographed by the irrepressible Daisy Spencer, Go Big promises ‘laughs bigger than your lock down lard’. Billy Suter enthused in his SoSuterBill review that the multi award winners never fail to raise a belly-laugh or two and Go Big proves no exception. “Directed with a sense of mischief and also deftly choreographed by Daisy Spencer, who has fashioned the duo’s last few shows, Go Big is loosely hung on a theme of arts activism. However, the new show, not unexpectedly, ricochets in all directions. It offers the team’s trademark collage of quirky sketches, some song and dance, and characters, which appear in a colourful parade of wigs and costumes.” “Go Big is a jumble of silliness and unpredictability, the programme including a funny nod to Dirty Dancing, a spot of drag, some flamenco dance and an Abba medley. We are also treated to a lyrically altered rendition of Big Spender performed by Mcilroy’s most popular character, Durban Indian VJ, who draws laughter aplenty during a comedy routine that takes many turns in direction. Fans will lap it up!” said Suter. The show features songs associated with The Divinyls, Simply Red, Eric Carmen, MC Hammer and Pitbull; Queen’s The Show Must Go On, Alphaville hit, Big in Japan and Black Eyed Peas’ Let’s Get It Started.
