Various social media platforms have become a panicked buzz of activities as unconfirmed notices of a proposed shutdown were made for Friday, 10 June. The circulating notices inform community members to stay off the roads as it is reported to be potentially chaotic on the day. Other notices allege that members of several groups, including the National Taxi Alliance and Santaco, are also in support of the National Shutdown.  The Provincial Spokesperson for Santaco, Mduduzi Makhunga, said that they will not be part of the protest. The Congress of the South African Trade Unions and other taxi industries have, since the circulation of notices, distanced themselves from the alleged shutdown. It is said that the shutdown is to be held due to the continuous increase in petrol prices.  It is clear that no shutdown has been confirmed by officials and police. It was also reported that citizens should abstain from forwarding alleged shutdown details as it causes confusion and unnecessary panic among communities.
