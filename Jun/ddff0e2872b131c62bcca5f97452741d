By Bronwyn M Singh Aletheia Christian College held their annual sports day on Friday, 27 May. The day got off to a cold and misty start, but that did not stop the learners from giving their all. Grades 1 through to 12 strutted their sportsmanship for their respective sport houses, the Lions and Bears, with spirit building, discus, high jump, long jump and sprinting races. As the sun began to make an appearance and warm up the day, sporting events carried on with much enthusiasm. Parents also got their chance to participate in a relay race with educators as their children cheered them on. Both the Lions and Bears displayed great talent during their respective events, but there could only be one winning team and the big trophy of the day went to the Lions, much to the delight of the team members. Congratulations to each learner who participated!
