As the country commemorates Child Protection Week, the Social Development Department has made a call for children to be protected 365 days of the year. Child Protection Week is commemorated from 29 May to 5 June annually to raise awareness on the rights of children as articulated in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and Children’s Act (Act No. 38 of 2005). The campaign is led by the Department of Social Development in partnership with key government departments and civil society organisations rendering child protection services. Throughout the country, programmes are held to raise awareness on the importance of child protection. KZN Social Development Department spokesperson, Mhlaba Memela said that child protection should not just be a once-off symbol but must be a 365 days task. “Children must be protected on a daily basis. I believe that we still need to work harder especially together with the Department of Education. There are so many concerns such as the high rate of teenage pregnancy,” he said.  To commemorate Child Protection Week, Westville-based school, St Elizabeth’s Pre-Primary learners had a lesson on how important it is for the society to protect children. School principal, Mrs Trish Oom, said: “I believe we have both a duty and responsibility to protect our precious children. Our children are the rock on which our future will be built and are our greatest asset as a nation.”
