Educators and learners of Buffelsdale Secondary School spent Wednesday commemorating the struggles and sacrifices of the youth of 1976. Miss J Naidoo, an educator at the school, said she and her colleague, Mrs Z.P. Dlomo are not just responsible for classroom education but also entrusted to teach their learners about historical events to help them better prepare for the future. She said: “Since the Soweto uprising 46 years ago, our children can see the progress we have made as a ‘Rainbow Nation.’ It is imperative that they build their confidence and develop a voice to be heard. It is events like these which allow learners a platform to do so. The youth of this country are our future leaders. Let memories celebrating their childhood with joyful and exuberant activities, be a start to develop leaders and improved lives in our communities.” Mrs Dlomo said: “We are giving our children opportunities that some haven’t had in their lives. We want to have  happy and healthy children at our school, and later becoming successful and meaningful leaders in our communities. This event required our learners to work twice as hard, as they were preparing for exams concurrently, and once again, they did not disappoint their audience. Buffelsdale Secondary not only prides ourselves with excellent academic results, we have fabulously ambitious children willing to own their moment.” Grade 12 learner, Tyrone Dharamraj said he is very proud of the “extremely talented” learners at his school. “The crowd loved the dances, speeches, music and poetry. It was great to see my peers making our school proud,” he said. Preshanthan Naicker said: “We thought the celebrations were amazing. I was truly inspired when I spoke to Ms J. Naidoo, after the programme. We also enjoy being part of the fun and festivities of these celebrations. Next, I would love to sing for my school.”
