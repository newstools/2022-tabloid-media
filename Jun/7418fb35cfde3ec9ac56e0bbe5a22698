The International Yoga Organisation of India together with DivyaShakti are giving residents a great opportunity to join a free Yoga for All Campaign to empower and educate themselves with the knowledge of Yoga. Meena Mothilal of DivyaShakti thanked Honorable Balaji, founder and chairman of the International Yoga Organisation of India, for creating this is campaign that aims to create a platform for all to experience the power of yoga in their life. Mothilal said: “Yoga is an ancient wisdom from India. Great masters perfected this knowledge and distributed it to disciples, Yoga is the practice of body postures, meditation and breathing control. The word yoga means ‘union.’ Derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Yuj’ which means ‘to unite, integrate’ being in union with the real you, the soul. Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warms up the muscles, Yoga is all about harmonising the body with the mind and breath through the means of various body postures, to improve and strengthen, balance and flexibility.” Mothilal added that Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. She said: “If you thought that yoga was all about bending and stretching your body into different postures, it is time to rethink. Yoga is much more. In very simple words, it is about giving deep and loving care to your body, mind and breath.” She urged residents to spend some time of their day in yoga practice as it can be a great way to get rid of stress from the body and mind. “Regardless of your level of yoga expertise, if you are practicing regularly, you can feel better from day to day. Learn the benefits of yoga and make it an integral part of your life,” she said. Residents are encouraged to join the free Yoga Campaign organised by the International Yoga Organisation which is currently running until 21 June on Zoom and face to face platforms.
