The Mount Edgecombe Country Club is set for a gaiety of golf at the second SunBet Durban City Pro-Am which takes place on Wednesday, 15 June.  The Pro-Am is a festival of golf that will see some of South Africa’s top Professional Golfers Association’s (PGA) professionals on the National Order of Merit and familiar names in golf take to the greens to battle it out for top honours in the tournament, hosted by Sibaya Casino and Entertainment Kingdom. Those who will be counting strokes include Brenden Pieters, Willem Lindeque, Dane Vosloo, Blanche Lamprecht and defending champion Kevin Stone to name a few. The tournament includes two formats, a team competition of one PGA professional and three amateurs over 36 holes and an individual competition for pros over 54 holes.  Last year, at the inaugural SunBet Durban City Pro-Am event, Kevin Stone, father of SA pro, Brandon Stone, walked away with the SunBet Durban City Pro-Am Cup. Stone scored 110 stableford points over the three days to clinch the title.  After turning professional in 1987, Stone played on the Sunshine Tour for 18 years. During this time he won eight Sunshine Tour events as well as winning the South African Club Professional Championship on nine occasions. On two occasions Stone also represented South Africa at the World Club Professional PGA Championship. In more recent times he has won five events on the Senior Tour. Desigan Arran, Sibaya VIP services manager welcomes players back to Mount Edgecombe’s greens. “We hope this year’s tournament is as successful as last year’s, as we draw illustrious players back again to compete for the title,” said Arran.  SA Ceo, Ivano Ficalbi added that the warmer climate of Durban will be a welcome break for those from the other chilly parts of the country. “All our participants are eagerly looking forward to this event, over both courses at Mount Edgecombe,” he said.
