Mtambo said after she completed her Bachelor of Education studies she couldn’t secure employment so she decided to gather children from the community and hold reading classes to assist them with homework and boost her résumé. “We began our classes and the children enjoyed the sessions. We were able to get books from a former school teacher in our neighbourhood. In 2020, Covid hit and we were forced to stop the sessions up until this year when I decided to bring it back again,” said Mtambo. She said from saving her R350 Social Distress Grant (SRD) for three months, she registered her organisation. “For three months I had to limit my spending. I did not go out with friends, did not do shopping and I saved for my dream to become a reality. My partner, Nompumelelo Phoswa, believed in me so much and she decided to join me so it’s a great partnership. “I began with less than 10 children and we held the classes in my backyard and now I get calls from parents and community members from other areas wanting me to introduce the classes in their areas as well. The demand is big and now I’m actually in need of facilitators to host book clubs in their neighbourhood for which I will provide starter packs and training,” Mtambo explained. She said the aim is to promote literature as well as to motivate children to read, write and be creative. “We are grooming poets, authors, artists. We call them our rising stars, we want to see them rising beyond what the human eye can see. We want our kids to be exposed to a different world, not just dream of becoming teachers and policeman but be motivated. We can achieve this only by allowing them identify the skills they have at a young age, nurture them and groom them so that they can have a better future for themselves.” Mtambo said the drive will be held on 16 June, Youth Day at the Corner of Westridge and Castlehill Drive at 10am to 3pm. “We are also hoping to get stationery such as crayons, colouring books, school books, pens and any type of stationery. With these we will be visiting crèches who are in need to donate some of the collected items to them so that the initiative can spread all over. Please join us in educating the future of our nation,” she added. For drop-offs or more information, Mtambo can be contacted on 072-853-0382 or contact Nompumelelo Phoswa on 076-718-5124.
