In promoting a clean environment, community organisation, Rotary Club of Westville has recently made a donation of a brand new Stihl bush cutter to a local cleaning community initiative, Keep Westville beautiful The organisation is made up of neighbours and community members who are united for the common good. They encourage and foster the development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service, high ethical standards in business and professions and promote understanding and peace through professional persons united in the ideals of service.  Public Relations Officer of the Rotary Club of Westville, Su Boertje said that they partnered with the Westville Environmental Trust which runs the recycling depot at the Westville Civic Centre. He added that reason they donated a bush cutter to Keep Westville Beautiful is to give full support to the community project.  “Keep Westville Beautiful does such an amazing job in keeping Westville looking its best that the rotary club decided to assist. This resulted in the collaboration with the Westville Environmental Trust, which works closely with the Rotary Club of Westville. Keep Westville Beautiful indicated they required a bush cutter and the rest is history,” said Boertje.  Chris Owen of the Westville Environmental Trust added that it is important to support community initiatives that are making a difference in their communities.  “We are delighted to be in a position to support Keep Westville Beautiful. It is such a wonderful initiative that is making an enormous impact. We have a long standing relationship with the Rotary Club of Westville and are proud to partner with them,” said Owen.
