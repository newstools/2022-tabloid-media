Through Operation Sukuma Sakhe, the KZN Department of Human Settlements recently appointed Ntokozweni Developers to undertake the construction of 30 housing units.  The Implementing Agent embarked on the process of beneficiary verification where it became clear that the construction would not take place as a majority of these beneficiaries were residing on privately-owned land. The municipality then initiated the social facilitation phase to engage the beneficiaries and recommended the relocation option for most of them. Those who were in dire need of housing opportunities agreed to relocate. The municipality then identified serviced sites at Ezakheni Section B, where these beneficiaries would relocate to. Council Leadership has convened various meetings with stakeholders and Council can confirm that the Implementing Agent is ready to commence with actual construction. Alfred Duma Municipality Mayor, Councillor Zama Sibisi, would like to thank all the stakeholders who made this initiative a success, taking into account that these beneficiaries consist of different designated groups ranging from child-headed households, people living with disabilities and displaced/destitute families.
