It’s expected to be another bumper season for the Sardine Run 2022 as the silver pilchard made an appearance at Margate Beach on Friday, kicking off a frenzy in the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Scores of residents rushed to the beach, armed with plastic bags and anything that they could find to catch the slippery fish. Speculation was already rife on social media about the price of the sardines. Founder of non-profit-organisation, Tidy Towns KZN South Coast, Vicky Wentzel said: “All indications are showing that we are looking forward to a bumper Sardine Run, with netting already taking place early on in the season. We welcome visitors to come and enjoy the spectacle and natural phenomena as millions of sardines, followed by dolphins and whales head in our direction.” Ugu South Coast Tourism (USCT), CEO Phelisa Mangcu said: “The past two years have brought some spectacular Sardine Run action to the KZN South Coast and we’re anticipating another bumper year. Lockdown restrictions meant that many weren’t able to experience the action which is why we’re really encouraging tourists to make the most of this opportunity. Our tourism operators are able to facilitate Sardine Run viewings from land, sea or skies, with ample fishing and diving opportunities also on offer.” The Sardine Run believed to be the planet’s biggest biomass migration, is accompanied by flocks of seabirds, cormorants, gulls and terns diving into the waters; while dolphins, game fish and even whales feast on the salty fish.
