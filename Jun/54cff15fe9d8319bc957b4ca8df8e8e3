The much-anticipated official opening of the Radisson Blu Hotel in uMhlanga on Friday, 3 June, was an exclusive affair with over 500 national and international figures in attendance. Among the list of attendees at the exclusive black tie event were King Misuzulu kaZwelithini, Premier of KZN Sihle Zikalala, Minister of Police Bheki Cele, MEC Ravi Pillay and eThekwini Mayor Xolisi Kaunda. Zikalala enthused that the project will catapult the growth triad of uMhlanga, Dube Tradeport and the Zimbali northern corridor to even greater heights as a blue chip investment destination. “While from March 2020 the country faced the consequences of a shutdown occasioned by Covid-19, in July 2021 KwaZulu-Natal also had to deal with a devastating civil unrest. This meant that when we were hit by the floods, the province was already carrying a massive social and economic burden. Among the hardest hit sectors in terms of loss of business and job losses was the tourism and hospitality industry. Tourism is a backbone of the KwaZulu-Natal economy.” He added that with this venture, KZN is a testament to hope and faith. “This hotel and the wider R4.5 billion Oceans development tick all the boxes of stimulating and propelling economic growth and more.  Radisson Blu is the silver lining for the KwaZulu-Natal economy after a cruel season. Radisson Blu is an African dream, the magic of new beginnings.” The establishment is set to give a much needed nudge to the local economy not only the tourism sector but also act as a catalyst to numerous job creations through a 36 000 square kilometre world-class luxury shopping mall which will have 103 retail outlets and would incorporate 22 international iconic luxury fashion brands such as Gucci and Burberry, 12 magnificent restaurants, a supercar dealership and the SA’s first snow-park. “After all the challenges we have faced, be assured that KwaZulu-Natal is bouncing back,” said Zikalala.
