The curtain of the Angling Professional League (APL) season recently closed with the hosting of the Closed Competition at Sandford from A to E. With many lucrative prizes on offer, the anglers tried their best to be on the honours list.  The format of this competition was different from the usual league format as the mass of the fish matters most and not the number of fish caught. As fate would have it, many anglers caught “pointers” while others failed to even get a “bite”. In the scaled category, Mark Ince of Stillwaters AC landed the heaviest carp of the day, tipping the scale at 3.220kg and pocketing R3 000 in cash, a Midas Tackle Voucher of R1 500 and a photoshoot voucher of R850 from Behind the Lens Photography. Sarfraz Khan (Breakwaters AC) finished second, landing a carp of 3.060kg and winning R1 500 (cash) and a Midas Tackle Voucher of R500; Thasheel Rooplall (Stillwaters AC) was in the third spot with a carp of 2.960kg and pocketed R1 000 and a voucher from Swift Racing. Minesh Gopi (Breakwaters AC – 2.805kg) won R500 and a baby grinder; Rajendra Garahoo (Challengers AC – 2.790kg) won a baby grinder; Vashil Singh (Breakwaters AC – 2.770kg) received a Legacy hamper; Shahid Akram (Dannhauser AC – 2.500kg) won a Legacy hamper and Mark Ince (Stillwaters AC – 2.430kg) secured another prize, receiving the RUT Supplies Hamper and a three-piece dessert bowl set. In the non-scaled category, Monty Slabbert (Breakwaters AC) landed a Barbel of 1.612kg to win R3 000 in cash, a Midas Tackle Voucher of R1 000 and a photoshoot voucher worth R650 from Behind the Lens Photography. Harold Verwey (Stillwaters AC) secured second spot with his barbel of 990g and received R1 000 in cash and a lady’s wrist watch. Sabelo Zwane of Dannhauser AC finished in third place and won R500 cash and a voucher from Swift Racing with his barbel of 754g; followed by Akthar Allijan (Challengers AC – 614g) who won R300 and a gent’s wrist watch. Monty Slabbert (Breakwaters AC – 454g) received a fishing reel; P Govender (Challengers AC – 406g) won a five-piece glass bowl set and Monty Slabbert (Breakwaters AC – 396g) received a six-piece glassware set. “We wish to thank all officials and members for their assistance and participation to ensure the success of the competition.
