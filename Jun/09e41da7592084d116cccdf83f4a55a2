The event which saw communities coming together, was held last Thursday, 23 June. MEC for Education, Kwazi Mshengu said the aim of the event was to put in building blocks towards creating a truly unified society. He said: “We remember the unfortunate events of the July 2021 civil unrest, where it did not only end with looting but also the death of many people. Some of them, in the areas of Phoenix, Chatsworth and Pietermaritzburg, were deliberately killed by criminals on the bases of their colour as some were killed on their way home and some died on the way to hospital. As government we have a responsibility to build a cohesive society and we took a decision that different departments must have different programmes as building blocks towards the society that we want. As the Department of Education (DOE), we decided that we are going to use sports as a catalyst to reach cohesion in the schooling environment but ultimately within our communities.” Mshengu further added that they want the youth to be the first generation to live in a truly non racial South Africa. He said “We are using sports to try and gather a sense of unity between different races. We want them to know that skin colour does not define who you are. We were all created in different colours but we remain one and that is what must drive us as a nation. If we are to build a South Africa of our dreams we should not avoid debating difficult issues so that we can challenge each other and correct each other when we are wrong. So that is why on the side-lines of the sporting games taking place we also added on a debate.” The social cohesion programme culminated with a gala dinner and cultural festival in Phoenix, which brought together members of the communities of Phoenix and Inanda presided by the premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Sihle Zikalala. The premier was accompanied by MEC for education, Kwazi Mshengu, MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Ravi Pillay and eThekwini executive councillor, Nkosenhle Madlala.  Former eThekwini speaker Logie Naidoo who is an ambassador in the social cohesion campaign was also in attendance. In his address, Premier Zikalala said that the programme was being launched on the eve of the first year since the civil unrest which saw the death of 37 people in Phoenix and plans were underway for the erection of a memorial in Phoenix.  He said the violence had brought embarrassment to the province and left racial undertones. “The image of the province was left tarnished locally, nationally and globally. There was an erosion of social and moral fibre of people in the province and reversals of gains we had made. Despite the challenging period, provincial government had embarked on a series of engagements with communities across the province. Among the sectors consulted are the taxi industry, business community, NGO’s and faith based organisations as they sought to redress and to return communities to a peaceful co-existence,” said Zikalala.  Zikalala called on the public to become ambassadors of a non-racial society. “This should include consciously understanding non-racialism in this country. We want to build a non-racial society – a society where a person is defined on the basis of being a human being, his or her abilities or talent. We are not just talking about co-existency, we are talking about integrating ourselves into one society and living together harmoniously. We have clear examples from the past that tell us if we are united, we can eliminate poverty and illiteracy and can build a prosperous society,” added Zikalala.
