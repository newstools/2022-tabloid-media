There were huge gulps of air, loud screeches and screams of support from fellow classmates as well as family members and friends who recently witnessed the bravest of the brave plunge into the icy-cold Egerton Primary School pool for the Animal Anti-Cruelty League (AACL) Polar Bear swim.  The annual event, which had taken a miss during Covid-19 lockdown, experienced tremendous support not only from learners of Egerton Primary School, but the educators as well. Despite the cloudy and rainy forecast for Thursday, 23 June, 18 swimmers lined up along the pool’s edge to swim in icy water for a great cause – the animals.  “I would like to thank the children and all who were involved in raising funds, blankets and food for all the animals at the shelters,” said AACL official, Pauline Lennon. Organiser of the fundraising event, Renette Brink, made sure that all those who had taken the icy plunge for the animals received a mug of delicious hot chocolate afterwards to warm up.
