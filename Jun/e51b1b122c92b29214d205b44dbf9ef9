An elderly Newlands couple endured the trauma of being held up at gunpoint when four suspects stormed into their Barvale Place home and robbed them of cash, jewellery and other items on Wednesday morning, 1 June. According to Slovo Tactical Spokesperson, Charmaine Singh, Newlands SAPS together with Slovo Tactical Unit and ADT responded to the reports of the house robbery in progress. “The members responded and upon arrival at the said address, the suspects departed. The elderly homeowner was interviewed by Slovo Tactical members and he stated that four men brandishing firearms accosted the couple inside their house.” According to the homeowner, the suspects are alleged to have taken cash, various jewellery items and bank cards. The elderly couple remained inside because they feared being attacked. “The couple did not see what vehicle the gang used in the commission of the crime and they were still severely emotionally traumatised after the ordeal. We urge residents to remain vigilant in the early hours of the morning as criminals use the cover of darkness to strike and commit their criminal ploys,” Singh added.
