The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (SANRAL) has announced that section 24 of the National Route 2 (N2) Northbound Carriageway between Umzinto and uMgababa is now open to traffic. Dumisani Nkabinde, SANRAL’s Eastern Regional Manager, said: “The road has undergone thorough project completion inspection and we have satisfied ourselves, as SANRAL, that all the requirements (especially road safety features) have been met. The deviation is one lane only which is a temporary measure to allow mobility and take pressure away from the R197 and R102.” Permanent reconstruction of the affected section of the N2 is well underway, as it stands, the engineers are currently busy with geotechnical investigations to finalise detailed design for the permanent repairs. On 18 April, after declaring the national state of disaster, President Ramaphosa designated SANRAL as the agency to lead the extensive work required to repair roads in the province, starting with an immediate focus on the N2 and N3 freeways. Since then, SANRAL has worked with the provincial and municipal authorities in KwaZulu-Natal to advance the rebuilding and rehabilitation work required to restore normality to the lives of the people in the province. “During the heavy rains and floods in April, the far-left lane of the N2 on the northern carriageway collapsed and settled by over a metre and moved down the embankment. SANRAL would like to thank the motorists for their patience while we are working on a permanent solution for the northern carriageway,” said Nkabinde.
