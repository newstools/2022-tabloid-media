Estcourt and Ladysmith SAPS and members of the Pietermaritzburg Bomb Disposal Unit were called to the R103, between Frere and Estcourt, after a cash-in-transit robbery was reported on Wednesday afternoon, 8 June.  The R103 was closed off to traffic to allow police officials to gather the evidence. It is reported that the security vehicle was travelling along the R103 when it was approached by two other vehicles. Unknown armed gunmen opened fire upon the security vehicle, causing the driver to lose control.  The gunmen then used an explosive device to gain access to the cash inside the protected vehicle. A large amount of money was taken during the armed robbery. The security officials had sustained slight injuries during the incident and a case has been opened with the police. No arrests have been made.
