Bouman had to keep looking over his shoulder to make sure visiting Cape surfski star, Mark Keeling, was not going to threaten the top step of the podium in the 26km dice from Pirates SLC to the Umhlanga Lighthouse and back. Bouman was inspired by the excellent conditions on the day as he mastered his local waters, a few days after World Oceans Day. “It was such a beautiful morning. The sea was looking so good and clean, conditions were really good and we were paddling with the dolphins. It’s all part of my preparation for the world champs so things went well today,” said Bouman. Fish Hoek ski star, Mark Keeling duly wrapped up second place with Gene Prato making up the balance of the podium. The fastest boat across the 26-kilometre course was the doubles crew of Richard Lowe and Jason Ekstrand who pulled away from Vernon Vogt and Marco Magni to win the S2 bragging rights and the overall line honours by more than five minutes. The women’s race saw Michelle Burn retain her title and signal her continued return to top form after injuring her shoulder in a river canoeing race in January. “This is never easy! Pirates Umhlanga Pirates is always one of the toughest races. A lot of the elite paddlers who are taking the SA marathon champs seriously decided not to race. I got into a little group of guys for the first five or six kilometres in our batch start, but when they started doing some serious intervals I decided to drop off and go a little more inshore. After the turn at the can off Umhlanga there was a slight bump but you had to work really hard to get onto the bumps. I went a little deeper on the return leg to try and use those bumps,” said Burn. The Marine Winter Surfski Series continues with the Bay Union King of the Bay on 26 June.
