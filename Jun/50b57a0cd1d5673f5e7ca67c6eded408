Point SAPS Station Commander, Captain I Pillay, said that the citizens of Point are requested to be part of this initiative to ensure a safe and secure precinct through strengthened partnerships, with all fighting structures. “The objective of the ‘Community in Blue’ is to promote reporting of criminal activities and any suspicious behaviour in the communities. It also increases visibility in order to deter criminal activities and provides a supportive initiative to be the eyes, ears and voice of the SAPS,” said Capt Pillay. He said that this is a voluntary service and no payment will be made to the members. “The volunteers are required to adhere to the principals of professionalism, accountability, dedication, commitment, honesty, transparency and non-discriminatory practices.” Capt Pillay said the requirements that need to be met are the following: the volunteer should be 18 years old or older, have a valid South African identity document (ID), provide a photograph, provide details of a next of kin, be prepared to undergo training and be a resident of the Point precinct. “Applicants are urged to contact Captain M Magin on 082-411-5706 or email her on pointdpo@saps.org.za to make an appointment.”
