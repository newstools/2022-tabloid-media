The 53rd edition of the The Ballito Pro presented by O’Neill will celebrate the return of international surfing to South African shores, as the World Surf League (WSL) Challenger Series (CS) for men and women draws in some of the best competitors in the world. The Challenger Series is the ultimate battleground for surfers fighting to qualify for a spot on the 2023 Championship Tour (CT). Across the eight international events, the fields of 96 men and 64 women battle for one of the 10 men’s and 5 women’s coveted spots at the top level of the sport. The Ballito Pro will be the third stop on the Challenger Series and will see more than 15 countries represented across the board. The men’s field is stacked with former Ballito Pro champions and local favourites such as Cape Townian Adin Masencamp and Durbanite, Jordy Smith. It also features Championship Tour surfers such as Conner Coffin and Ezekiel Lau, and up-and-coming rookies like Rio Waida, who won the previous CS event, the Sydney Surf Pro. In the women’s draw, former Ballito Pro champions Zoe Steyn from East London and Sarah Baum from Durban will come up against some fierce international competition. The top local men and women surfers, who did not qualify for the Challenger Series, will get another chance to earn a spot in the main competition with the Ballito Pro trails. The winners will claim the WSL wildcard entry into the Challenger Series. “WSL Africa is excited to be hosting one of the blue-ribbon events on the Challenger Series. The opportunity to see the best women surfers alongside the men makes this a unique event for Africa. Our sincere thanks to the KwaDukuza Municipality, O’Neill South Africa, event management and the many sponsors for making this the premier event for Africa. I am positive, like always, that many of these surfers will go on to become household names in the world of surfing over the next few years,” said WSL Africa Operations Manager Colin Fitch.
