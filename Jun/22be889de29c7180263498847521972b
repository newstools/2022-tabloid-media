The Tidy Towns Shelly to Margate volunteers recently worked together to remove debris along Marine Drive at the Uvongo Park.Tidy Towns Shelly to Margate is a community-driven project, supported by the joining of hands of like-minded volunteers, private security companies, Ray Nkonyeni Municipality, local Law Enforcement, the SAPS and the business sector. Manager of Tidy Towns Shelly to Margate, Stephen Herbst said that when they conducted the clean-up at the Uvongo Park, they received a heads-up from the community. “This entire movement is to promote the South Coast and to ensure it’s beauty is maintained. We encourage community members from Shelly Beach to Margate to visit us to see what we do and interact with the volunteers,” he said. Herbst added that the Tidy Towns Shelly to Margate initiative also aims to improve job opportunities and alleviate crime. “Everything that we do has a selfless approach and we are trying to ensure that we keep our volunteers employed and get them off the streets. It’s total rehabilitative measures for the forgotten people on the streets of South Coast,” said Herbst. Ward Councillor for Uvongo, Manaba Beach and St Michaels on Sea under Ray Nkonyeni Municipality, George Henderson, said that the Tidy Towns Shelly to Margate is a fantastic initiative that assists the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality. “This team of volunteers started operating in 2010 and they operate solely on generous donations from the public. They are very hands on with assisting the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality as we currently face a decrease in levels of service delivery,” said Cllr Henderson.
