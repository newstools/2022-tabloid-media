Charity organisation, Kloof Round Table 190 hosted their fifth annual Golf Day to raise funds for a grandmothers (Gogos) programme recently at the Kloof Country Club.  The Golf Day saw 92 golfers in attendance and numerous companies from the Upper Highway area who got  involved by sponsoring prizes and setting up gazebos on various tee-boxes. The R30 000 raised on the day will go towards the organisation’s initiative ‘Goals4Gogos’ which supports the grandmothers’ programme of the Hillcrest Aids and Centre Trust’s Gogo Development Programme. Matthew Helm of Kloof Round Table said that this program is one which the Golf Day has been supporting from the outset and has seen over 70 gogos being trained in the use of sewing machines, also receiving their own one so that they can manufacture clothing for their grandchildren as well as making various items for them to sell within their communities. “The involvement of Kloof Round Table in the Gogo Development Program recently went one step further. With some sundry funds remaining from the generous donations made by Grindrod Logistics Africa, we were able to facilitate the purchasing and distribution of several vegetable tunnels from BUCO. Several of the gogos were trained on site by the HACT team and the tunnels installed at their homes. This has seen them being able to plant and grow their own vegetables – an initiative which has been extremely successful!. We are truly blessed to be involved in such a caring community and would like to thank all those companies who got involved on the day through the sponsoring of prizes or tee-boxes and to all the players who came out to support,” said Helm. Helm also thanked the  Kloof Country Club for playing host  and ensuring that they day was such a success. “We look forward to hosting another one next year and can only hope that we are able to build on this success and continue to make an impactful change within our community,” added Helm.
