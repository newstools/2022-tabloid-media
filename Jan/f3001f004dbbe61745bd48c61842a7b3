Phoenix Police cordoned off Northside Road where the shooting took place just after 1pm. It is believed that the victim was walking along the road when he was shot multiple times. Residents said that they heard “loud noises” that they presumed to be fireworks and only later realised that someone was shot when they heard police sirens. Several spent 9mm cartridges were discovered at the scene. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, said police were investigating the shooting. “The deceased was found on the roadside with multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body and legs. He was lying on his back on the side of the road. A bystander who heard the gunshots alerted the police who rushed to the scene and found that the man had succumbed to his injuries. A grey vehicle was seen fleeing the scene after the shooting incident. The registration and model of the vehicle are both unknown. Capt Naidoo said that police could not obtain any video footages. “The CCTV at one of the residences opposite the crime scene was not operational. The motive for the shooting is unknown at this stage. No arrests have been made, police investigations are continuing,” said Capt Naidoo.
