A Pretoria High Court ruling has forced the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to make a u-turn on their decision not to publish matric results on public platforms, following a victory by various organisations including AfriForum who challenged the move. In a statement released on Tuesday morning following the court ruling, the Department said they take note of the Pretoria High Court ruling regarding the release of the National Senior Certificate examination results on media platforms and will abide by the ruling. “This means that the Department will make available the results to stakeholders who requested access. The conditions of the court ruling must be taken into account in line with the provisions of the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013. In addition to accessing results from media platforms, the Department also urges candidates to register on the website to view the results when they become available,” department spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, said. Matriculants will have to go through a two-step verification process before receiving confirmation of their registration. A 13-digit ID number and exam number will be required for registration. The DBE website is zero-rated, which means it can be accessed whether you have data or not.
