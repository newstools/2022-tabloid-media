Police are still searching for the elusive “close relative” of Phoenix resident, Reuben Chetty, who was stabbed to death in a deadly confrontation outside his flat on the Day of Goodwill. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, said: “Phoenix SAPS member, Sergeant Nala, stated that he responded to a complaint of murder at Broadfern Close where he noticed a group of people standing around a body that was covered in a white cloth. Upon inspecting the body, he noticed two stab wounds on the left side of the deceased’s chest and blood on the floor. “A red-handled screwdriver was lying between the deceased’s legs. The deceased was pronounced dead by the paramedic from the Provincial Ambulance Service. Upon interviewing a witness, she stated that the deceased was known to her and identified him as Reuben Chetty who lived at Broadfern Close. The witness alleged that Reuben and a relative were arguing inside their house and then came outside.” Capt Naidoo said that according to the witness, she watched through a window and noticed that family members were fighting. “She saw Reuben walking towards the stairs and questioned him about what happened. At that point, she saw the blood on his chest and he realised that he was stabbed. The victim informed the witness that his relative had stabbed him. The relative fled the scene. No arrests have been made as yet and a search is underway for the runaway suspect,” Capt Naidoo said. <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-67448" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300,h_400/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-300x400.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-300x400.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-150x200.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-600x800.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-696x928.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_315/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-315x420.jpg 315w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_630/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2-630x840.jpg 630w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_720/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/murder-2.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />A case of murder is being investigated. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) also responded to the stabbing. “It was established that the deceased, a 41-year-old man, denied his 43-year-old brother access into their home due to him previously stealing household items to satisfy his drug addiction. The suspect then produced a screwdriver and stabbed his sibling before he fled the scene,” said RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram. Phoenix Community Police Forum chairperson, Umesh Singh, said: “This is yet another horrific murder to rock the community of Phoenix. The scourge of drugs is wreaking havoc in the area and destroying the fabric of our society. Drug addicts are ruthless in their pursuit for a quick fix and sadly, a human life is just collateral damage in the hunt to feed an addiction. “We need the community to help authorities to clamp down on drug dens and we are trusting that police will work diligently to ensure that justice prevails in this callous killing,” said Singh.
