Ayabulela Abongwe Kubheka, 10, from the Nyezane area in Estcourt was found dead on Christmas Day after allegedly being killed for witchcraft practices.  A 32-year-old suspect, alleged to be the uncle and neighbour of Kubheka, has been arrested and charged with murder. The uncle appeared briefly in the Estcourt Magistrate’s Court and will remain in police custody until his next court appearance on 6 January. The case is still being investigated by the Estcourt Police. Kubheka was reported missing on 15 December 2021 by his grandmother. “The grandmother, who had left him in bed to warm a meal, returned to find Kubheka missing. The matter was reported to the police,” said Colonel Thembeka Mbele. On Christmas Day, relatives of Kubheka found a dog walking outside with a human leg in its mouth. Relatives spotted other dogs digging in the neighbour’s yard and upon further investigation found a shallow grave with the remains of Kubheka. The 32-year-old suspect attempted to escape but was apprehended by the community. The suspect allegedly told the community that he killed the boy by choking him because he needed his body to protect his house from being bewitched by people so he dug a shallow grave in his yard and buried the child. “The community is applauded for not taking the law into their own hands by attacking the suspect and informing the police. People who continue to commit vigilantism will face the might of the law,” concluded police.
