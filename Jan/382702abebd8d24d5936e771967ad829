The family of a Montford pensioner, Anwar Shaik, who was killed in an alleged hit-and-run incident on Road 701 on Wednesday, are hoping that police will find the person who knocked him before speeding off. According to his family, 75-year-old Shaik took a walk from his home in Road 706 to the nearby Montford Shopping Centre to purchase some items and while returning home he was run over by a speeding vehicle. Summoned by members of the community, Siven Soobramodey from Amawele Emergency Services said paramedics who responded found the elderly man with extensive injuries and showing no signs of life. “The patient had suffered numerous serious injuries and had been declared dead at the scene,” he added. Shaik’s nephew, Sohil Moosa, said their family is traumatised regarding the manner in which he was killed. “My uncle was a fit person who enjoyed walking to the shop as he enjoyed his independence. He was always cautious wherever he went. We cannot understand how someone can knock an elderly man and drive away without checking if they were okay or if they needed medical attention. My uncle was injured badly, with visible critical injuries from his waist to his head. We know that nothing will bring him back but we hope that police find the person who was driving the vehicle so that they can face the consequences of negligent driving and disobeying the law,” he said. Shaik was described by his family as a humble person who was caring and helpful. “He was a self-employed skilled worker who was well-known in the community. He enjoyed his retirement by spending time with his family and friends. He will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him,” said Moosa. The grandfather of four was laid to rest on Thursday. His family urge anyone who may have witnessed the accident to provide police with information.
