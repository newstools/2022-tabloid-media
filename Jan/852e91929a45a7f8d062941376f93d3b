2021 has come to an end and has undoubtedly had its share of ups and downs. While dealing with ongoing trauma, the stress of a pandemic and facing up to economic crisis, the middle of the year proved to be one of the lowest points of South Africa’s democratic history with a spree of looting, violence and destruction which hit KwaZulu-Natal with a force. However, many are optimistic about the new year and hope that 2022 will see the end of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent restoration of a failing economy. Among those looking forward to the adventures of the new year is four-year-old Niane` Landsberg, who will be attending Grade RR this year. Niane` joins the management and staff of the Newcastle Express in wishing our advertisers and readers a blessed and prosperous new year.
