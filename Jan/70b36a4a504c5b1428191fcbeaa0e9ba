Third-year journalist student, Amanda Lerato Moloi, began her modelling career in 2019, during matric, and ever since then, this 20-year-old beauty has vowed to use her titles to make a change in the lives of others. Moloi holds more than 10 beauty pageant titles to her name, including that of Miss TUT Soshanguve 2020 where she was crowned first princess. She was also crowned Miss Madadeni Queen last October and is the current reigning queen. “I have done a lot of charity work over the years including visiting orphanages and old age homes. During the festive season, I gifted party packs to the children in my street because I firmly believe that charity begins at home. Seeing the children happy melted my heart just because children don’t need much, they just need a reason to smile,” said Moloi. <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-67891" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_267,h_400/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-267x400.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="400" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_267/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-267x400.jpg 267w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_683/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-150x225.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-300x450.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1068/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-1068x1602.jpg 1068w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_280/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-280x420.jpg 280w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_560/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027-560x840.jpg 560w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1080/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220111-WA0027.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" />The beauty with brains is also an advocate against bullying. “As a model, I firmly stand against verbal abuse and cyber-bullying which I believe are the roots of most of the problems we are experiencing as a society,” she said. For 2022, Moloi plans on running a campaign which raises awareness on bullying and she hopes that in doing so, it will reduce depression and anxiety among the younger generation. When she is not working the runway, Moloi loves to read and travel. “I also support other models when they are busy with competitions. I believe that a queen is someone with integrity and who leads by example while resembling all the qualities that will inspire everyone who looks up to her,” she said. She is also currently busy with the Miss United South Africa Pageant which will take place on 5 March in Durban.
