The Indian Land Claimants Association recently met with Ward 110 Councillor, Aamir Abdul, to discuss the possibility of returning to their claimed lands. ILCA chairperson, Robin Naidoo, said that discussions consisted of stories of the forced removals from Durban North and surrounding areas, the current land and housing problems within Phoenix and Mount Moriah and the ILCA’s intention to return to their former claimed land. “These vacant unclaimed lands are boarded and surrounded by the Red Hill Cemetery on the East, Moreland Industrial Park on the West and the electricity depot on the South. It is most unfortunately being invaded by illegal land invaders on the Northern parts, spurred on by the impotent municipality who remain silent and won’t force a 2013 high court interdict against them,” said Naidoo. “Councillor Abdul promised to look into all our land claims, which is ultimately in the municipality’s hands, and requested communication so that it can be escalated to council for answers and solutions to break the impasse of over 28 years.” Naidoo said that he would like to hear from any land claimant in the area or of the Greater Durban North, Riverside and Virginia as well. He added that claimants from other areas surrounding Durban will also be assisted. For more information, contact Robin Naidoo on 071-300-8228.
