Sweet melodies filled the air recently when a group of musicians of yesteryear got together and staged a ‘Legends Music Concert’ to honour their fallen mates in the fields of music and soccer. Held at The Italian Club on Harvey Street, in Umkomaas, the music maestros paid tribute to colleagues who succumbed to the Corona virus and others who passed away from natural causes. Spokesperson, Abel Arumugam, said: “Members from the South Coast successful pop bands from yesteryear that graced the local pop music scene over many years were honoured at this event. It was a mixture of music and soccer when fond tributes were paid to members from The Themes from Renishaw, Sounds Invasion and Chain Reaction from Willow Glen together with some soccer players of Glens United Football Club, a club that competed successfully in the local soccer league. An overhead picture presentation was viewed by guests during the evening, taking them on a nostalgic journey of their deceased family members with the respective bands and some video clips of their stage appearances at the many band reunions over the years. “The evening was rounded up with a scrumptious meal enjoyed by the guests who also tucked into the delicious ‘Legends Cake’ that was cut on the night. The evening quickly turned from solemn to festive with tunes from current Umkomaas band ‘Dancing Juice’ and MC Ashwin Mahipath. The band took the guests on a musical journey, playing some current and classic hits that had guests swaying to the rhythm of the beat,” Arumugam said.
