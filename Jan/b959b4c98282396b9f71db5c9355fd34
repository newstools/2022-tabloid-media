Working over 20 hours to trace the whereabouts of three children who were kidnapped from their home in Havenside at gunpoint on Monday, members of the Bayview SAPS were glad to have been able to reunite the siblings with their parents in the early hours of Tuesday morning, 21 December 2021. It is alleged that eight armed men, travelling in four vehicles, broke into the family’s home on Monday, 20 December 2021, at about 11am. The children, aged nine, 11 and 13, were alone at home when the men gained entry and kidnapped them at gunpoint. Communications Officer of Bayview SAPS, Warrant Officer Collin Chetty, said a team of dedicated and committed detectives of SAPS Bayview, under the leadership of Bayview SAPS Detective Branch Commander Captain Naidu, ensured the safe return of the three children. He said: “During this time the incident was happening, a neighbour alerted the mother of the children, who then contacted the father, who is currently in Gauteng Province. The father indicated that he owes the suspect some money. The suspect indicated that once he receives the money, he will return the kids. Bayview detectives, immediately after arriving on the scene, started their investigations and called in specialised units.” Hostage negotiators and crime intelligence units worked together and investigations led them to Umhlali, where eventually the suspect left the children at Mndeni SAPS. “When the suspect realised that the police were hot on his trail, he left the children at Mndeni SAPS. The pressure put on the suspect by members led to the children being released safely to the SAPS. Members worked over 20 hours to ensure that these children were brought safely back to their family and home. We are happy the children were safely found and home for Christmas,” added W/O Chetty.
