Newlands West resident, Brandon Marimuthu, 31, who died after being stung by a swarm of bees on 12 January was laid to rest on Tuesday morning.  His cousin, Theron Pillay described him as a person who always left a good impression on everybody. “He was one of a kind, even though he was a so called Down syndrome person he was capable. We have lost a good person in our family,” he said. The deceased and his mother, Vasie Marimuthu were walking home when they were attacked by a swarm of bees. The hive was located on the side of Barondale Road in Newlands West. They rushed for help from neighbours at a complex across the road. Marimuthu was rushed to King Dinizulu Hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries. Shanti Lalchand, 63, was another resident who was stung by bees after Marimuthu and her son rushed to her home for help. “I was in my kitchen when I heard my friend and her son screaming. When I opened the door, I saw them full of bees. The bees also attacked me. I couldn’t help them as I also got attacked. We were running around frantically in the complex parking lot trying to get rid of the bees. “They were all over our bodies and were uncontrollable.  My neighbours were helpless as they watched through the window. After about 45 minutes of trying to remove the bees from our bodies, I ran inside my house where I took a cold shower,” said Lalchand. Her son took her to a private hospital where she was treated and stabilised. “I thank God that I survived. My prayers are with the Marimuthu family. May God give them the strength they need during this difficult time,” she added.
