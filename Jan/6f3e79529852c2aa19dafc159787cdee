The 2022 academic year has kicked off, despite the grey cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic still hovering above. Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, said in a recent media briefing that all Covid-19 protocols will still be in place as learners return for the new year. The pandemic has had a devastating impact on schooling and many are hoping for things to return to some sort of normalcy. “With regards to schooling, the situation will remain the same, especially rotational timetabling, where it was applicable when schooling concluded in 2021. The fact of the matter is that Covid-19 is still very much with us and we need to continue to work together to fight it,” said Motshekga. She further explained that some grades lost over 405 hours of learning and teaching time, which have undoubtedly affected learner drop-out rates and performance. Many parents have also carried the burden of the pandemic with many feeling the strain of assisting their children in playinh “catch up” with the syllabus. Cheryl Vermaak is one such parent who hopes that 2022 will be a better year for her children. “I have three kids, all under the age of 16, and last year was tough, dealing with rotational timetables while assisting all three with the vast amount of homework after a full day of work. Being a single parent didn’t make it any easier. I do hope that this year, learners will have a better year and that no teaching time is lost,” she said.
