The parents and active community participants of Brookdale, Phoenix, banded together to host the youth on Friday to an educational programme ahead of the new academic year. Sindi Mzimela, who co-ordinated the programme assisted by Fundi Mlaza and Mrs Luthuli from the community, said: “We hosted the Brookdale Girl Child community involvement programme after noticing that some of our teenage girls were beginning to accommodate some social ills and were becoming aggressive towards some of their peers in the area. “Our guest speakers for the day were Brookdale Primary School educators, Luyanda Ngcobo and Mrs Mqadi, and lawyer, Phumla Manzi-Ntshingila, who engaged the youth in various topics such as peer pressure, bullying, girls to womanhood and boysto manhood discussions.” Mzimela said that a Miss Brookdale Junior and Senior pageant as well as a baking skills session was also hosted. The day was a success thanks to the many parents from the community who came out in full support of the programme. We thank our donors, Mr Danifa and Mr Adam for their generous contributions towards the initiative. We are confident that our children will go back to school with appreciation and kindness towards each other. Congratulations to all our pageant winners and a big thank-you to the Brookdale community at large,” said Mzimela.
