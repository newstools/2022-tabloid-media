KwaZulu-Natal welcomed close to 270 new citizens on New Year’s Day, marking not only the beginning of a new year but of new life as well. According to KZN Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane, the province’s first New Year’s baby was born at Mosvold Hospital, under the Umkhanyakude District, shortly after midnight. “Interestingly, we have a set of twin girls who were born at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital to a 25 year-old mother, Ziyanda Madikizela. The first twin arrived at 3am, weighing in at 2.05kg, followed by the second one two minutes later who weighed 2.36kg,” she said. Meanwhile, the Minister of Health, Dr Joe Phaahla, said that South Africa welcomed 1 764 babies, born at various public healthcare facilities across the country, on New Year’s Day. He said: “A child’s health is most vulnerable during the first 1 000 days of their lives, and the right nutrition during this period can have a profound impact on a child’s ability to develop and learn.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67470" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696,h_464/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="464" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1068/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_630/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1260/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1280/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KZN-welcomes-264-New-Years-babies-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" />Dr Phaahla also encouraged all mothers to consider exclusive breastfeeding for their babies for the first six months of life and ensure they get necessary immunisations from birth, and to always remember to take their Road-To-Health-Booklet, previously known as a Clinic Card to the hospital or clinic as it keeps track of the child’s immunisation which shows doctors and nurses the child’s growth. Amid the celebrations, MEC Simelane addressed the issue of children birthing children. She said: “Once again, we have to register our concern that among these mothers is a 15-year-old, two 16-year-olds, a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old. In the case of the 15-year-old girl, the father is 18 years old. You then begin to realise that the mother was just 14 years old when she conceived, while the boy was 17. So, these are just children, who are nowhere near ready for the responsibilities that come with bringing a child into the world. We therefore can never over-emphasise the risks that our girls are exposed to when they fall pregnant. Not only are they in danger of potentially fatal pregnancy-related ailments, but their prospects of fulfilling their potential as human beings are vastly diminished.” MEC Simelane called upon parents, guardians, educators and community leaders to have open and frank conversations with their children about the benefits of abstinence and responsible sexual behaviour. “We also re-iterate our call for society to expose and help bring to book any man who impregnates a girl aged 16 and below, because that constitutes statutory rape. We also urge law enforcement authorities to adopt a zero-tolerance stance against this scourge that continues to bedevil our society,” she said.
