Dr Narraindoo said she aims to begin a non-government organisation to create a larger impact in the community. The Chatsworth Tabloid recently caught up with Dr Sharmain Narraindoo to find out more about her and what she does when she is not helping out the community. Chatsworth Tabloid (CT): Who is Dr Sharmain Narraindoo?  Sharmain Narraindoo (SN): I am from the warmest part of northern KwaZulu-Natal in Newcastle, but I currently reside in Queensburgh. I am a passionate, dedicated, friendly, God-centred, goal-orientated person who does not back down when challenged. I am a general practitioner who focuses on family health, community-based medicine. I deal with day-to-day concerns as well as managing one’s health and preventing it from progressing to its irreversible state. I focus more on preventing disease which will enable individuals to function to their optimal potential; lifestyle modification. CT: Where did you complete your studies and what are your qualifications? SN: I obtained my medical degree in Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery at Shandong Medical University in China. CT: What are some of the challenges you faced to make your dream come true? SN: The greatest challenge I faced was coming from a well-sheltered nest, my homeland then having to fly out into a foreign country. I had to stand on my own and help myself to be efficient, effective and most of all very self-sufficient, I have always been independent around the home thanks to my parents and my granddad, but I had to figure life out myself. I have great morals and values that have carried me this far and I have always been anchored in Christ. I had to be focused and not affected by the circumstances around me and learn to adapt to situations. I missed home and my family dearly, the South African culture, the lifestyle, and not forgetting the food. CT: Tell us about the religious impact on your life and studies. SN: I have always been a firm believer in the Christian faith. For me, it is a personal relationship with God and not just a religion. I live by faith and not by what I see. God has always been the centre of my life and I include him in every detail of my life. I trust God with everything I am. I stood firm and steadfast on his promises of: • #Joshua 1:5 – God will never leave you nor forsake you. • #Isaiah 41:10 – So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right. • #Psalm 46:10 – Be still, and know that I am God. CT: What community work are you involved in? SN: On a personal capacity, I assist the less fortunate families, feed homes and supported my husband in ministry in serving the community of Shallcross. Being in the government sector made it difficult to get involved further because you are constantly overworked and exhausted. I plan on opening an NGO in honour of my dear husband – Evangelist Adrian Sukooa and making a bigger impact in the lives of those around me. I have a passion for women and children and recently God has acquainted me with so many strong women who I would join forces with. CT: What drives your passion? SN: The love of Christ, to serve mankind beyond myself, to assist where I can because of my abilities. I enjoy being able to assist someone to live a better life – mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally! CT: What have been some of the highlights in your journey thus far? SN: I think the greatest highlight would be the ability to have travelled, explored and developed myself as a strong person without limitations; being brave, bold and optimistic in everything. Finding my feet in anything and standing firm, not forgetting being street smart because that comes without qualifications! CT: Do you have a motto that you live by? SN: When the going gets tough, the tough get going! CT: What are three things you cannot go a day without? SN: It would have to be faith, love and forgiveness. Faith to hold onto God’s promises, to love beyond myself just like Christ loves us, unconditionally and to forgive and let go of things because that is personal love. CT: What is one thing you love about being a doctor? SN: I can make a difference and an impact in people’s lives around me, that I can be humble and reach out to absolutely anyone, even the most difficult person. CT: What is one thing that makes you feel helpless as a doctor? SN: People have become accustomed to certain lifestyles and it’s difficult to change a set mind for better health, they lack insight. I believe mental health is vital to sustain yourself in this life. Life has many challenges and you as an individual can only truly support yourself to be propelled forward. Poverty has always been around but hard work, dedication and perseverance helps one to overcome it. CT: What does a day in your life look like? SN: For the past few years I have had the privilege of working in a government hospital, which can be overwhelming due to the high patient volume. You constantly have to make ways to accommodate the overloaded healthcare system. You are physically exhausted and over-worked but at the end of the day, I do the best I can for my patients and ensure that they get optimum assistance required. CT: If you had to switch lives with your role model for a day, who would it be and why? SN: I do not personally have any role models, Christ has always been my mentor, and for me it would have to be more like him every day. You cannot be anyone else for a day but you can be a perfect someone for life through the love of God. CT: When you lived in China, what was your go-to meal?  SN: It would definitely be BBQ that was done on skewers, that was the closest to a braai, especially when you missed home! CT: What is the best piece of advice for aspiring healthcare workers?  SN: We often forget this but remember always take care of yourself as that is the only way you can truly take care of others. You are in a great position to touch many people’s lives.  No matter how challenging life is always put God first, He will give you the strength to go on. There is always calm after the storm. Always believe, have faith and keep hope alive. Life is truly beautiful and you are the artist of your own life and if there is anything that the last two years of the pandemic has taught us is to live our best lives now and to be prepared for anything.  We have lost a lot recently and it is only God that can help us complete this race. Always be kind, do your best and hold tight onto God. Take care, keep safe and God bless!
