Twenty-four-year-old Zama Zwana was deemed unfit to own or possess a firearm by a magistrate at Scottburgh Magistrate’s Court for the abuse he inflicted on his mixed-breed pitbull. According to Amanzimtoti SPCA’s Animal Inspector, Luke Keyser, the dog, who was under one year old, had to be euthanised as it had suffered severe trauma. “We received a call in August 2021, where we were notified of a man in Umkomaas who had cut off his dog’s testicles with a knife. When I arrived at the scene, the dog was still alive but we could not help the dog any further as it had been critically injured. The dog was also psychologically affected by the trauma of the incident and we had to put the dog down. At court, we heard that the reason the man had committed such an act was that the dog kept going into the neighbouring farm, therefore he chose the act as a form of punishment for the dog,” said Keyser. The Amanzimtoti SPCA thanked the state prosecutor, Mr Naidoo, for being dedicated to getting justice for the dog and said he believes that the case will set a precedence to other animal abuse cases. “Animal abuse should not be tolerated in society. This should be both a warning and a deterrent to others who abuse animals. People who abuse animals and who have no empathy to that extent are more likely to move onto committing more serious crimes and continue from animals onto humans. This should, therefore, be an eye-opener to people,” added Keyser. Michelle Hanna from the Amanzimtoti SPCA said the sentence was a huge win for animals and encouraged residents to blow the whistle on animal abuse.
