The festive season may have come to a close but for bathers and fisherfolk in the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, the lifting of the swimming and fishing ban has been met with a great sigh of relief. With the blistering heat continuing and the closure of a number of beaches causing discomfort, the announcement by the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Ravi Pillay, that it is now safe to swim in Uvongo and Lucien beaches, has brought much joy to residents and holidaymakers. Pillay said: “This is welcomed news to all of us, especially the tourism sector and businesses along the coastal line of the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality. We felt their pain when beach activities were not possible because of the contamination of water. However, the need to protect public health, livelihoods and sustainability of the environment outweighed any other possibility, hence the decision to close the beaches.” Uvongo Beach was closed during the peak of the festive season, from 30 December 2021, due to high toxicity levels caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in the water. Pillay said vandalism of sewage pumps in the KwaMasinenge low cost housing projects caused a spill to run downstream, leading to the lagoon and eventually to the beach. The situation was compounded by some mechanical faults in the Ugu District Municipality Uvongo Sewer Treatment Plant and thereby releasing untreated sewage directly into the lagoon and the beach. The department said Uvongo Beach and its lagoon showed a drastic drop in the overnight E. coli readings for tests conducted on Monday, 10 January, which prompted the decision to re-open the beach immediately. Lucien Beach was closed on Friday, 7 January, due to a ruptured sewerage pipe that feeds into one of the pump stations along the coastline. The pipe was fixed but the beach remained closed due to high E. coli levels. Pillay said the spillages could have been avoided. “We are concerned by an apparent lack of proper management of some of these treatment pumps. Notwithstanding the ageing infrastructure and limited budgets, municipalities must adhere to strict maintenance plans which will help detect and prevent any problems with their sewerage systems,” he said. Meanwhile, the eThekwini Municipality has also re-opened Reunion Park Beach, Pipeline Beach, Amanzimtoti Main Beach, Warner Beach, Winkle Beach and Umgababa Beach after a sewage spill also forced their closure at the height of the season, leaving tourists and residents alike frustrated. Municipal spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said eThekwini was doing everything in its power to ensure that all beaches are safe for the public to use soon, following some backlash from the public and holidaymakers. He said: “The closure of beaches is not intended at frustrating the public but is a precautionary measure by the City to guard against members of the public bearing the brunt of contaminated water by falling ill. More tests are going to be carried out and eThekwini will continuously update the public in the event of new developments. EThekwini Municipality again sincerely apologises to the public and the business community for the inconvenience this unfortunate situation has caused.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67804" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696,h_928/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="928" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-300x400.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-150x200.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-600x800.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-696x928.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_315/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-315x420.jpg 315w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_630/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4-630x840.jpg 630w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_960/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-4.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-67803" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696,h_928/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="928" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-300x400.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-150x200.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-600x800.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-696x928.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_315/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-315x420.jpg 315w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_630/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3-630x840.jpg 630w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_960/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/South-Coast-beaches-reopen-3.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" />
