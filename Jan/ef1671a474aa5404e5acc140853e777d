In a statement issued this week, SAPO said the full renewal process, including payment, would be done online, leaving only the last step of accessing the licence disc. The licence disc can be delivered to the customer at an affordable delivery fee or it can be collected from a post office counter. “Payment is done safely and securely through Masterpass, which the user can download from the Google Play Store for Android devices and the Apple App Store for Apple devices. “No commission is charged on the renewal transaction. The cost of delivery to door is R75 and there is no charge to the customer when it is collected from a post office counter,” SAPO said. The customer will receive an SMS when the disc arrives at a post office for collection or when it goes out for delivery with a turnaround time of three working days, while it may be up to two days longer for outlying areas. “The online application for the renewal of motor vehicle licences is the first step to turn the ‘SAPO in my Pocket’ strategy into reality and will enable the customer to complete the entire process in the comfort of their own homes or offices. “The service is available for vehicle owners in all provinces of South Africa except, currently, the Western Cape. The SA Post Office is working to extend the service to this province as well,” SAPO said. The service is available on the website: https://www.sapomvl.co.za.
