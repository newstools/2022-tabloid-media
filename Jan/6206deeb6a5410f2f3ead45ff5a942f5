Umbilo SAPS station commander, Colonel Teddy Munusamy, invites residents and persons employed in the Umbilo Sector 3 area to attend a special meeting for the election of a Sector 3 sub-forum in the area. The meeting will take place on Saturday, 19 February, at 2pm at the Assumption Church Hall on 354 ZK Matthews Road. Boundaries of Sector 3 are Edwin Swales (South), Rick Turner (North), South Coast Road (East) and Grosvenor Road (West). “The purpose of the meeting is to elect sub-forum committee members to represent the Sector 3 community. This will also assist in creating a safer environment for all and it is imperative that as a community we protect, serve and work together in partnership with the South African Police Service and role-players, creating a safe and secure environment for all residents and visitors,” said Col Munusamy. Umbilo Executive Community Policing Forum Spokesperson, Heather Rorick, said: “Those attending must give proof of residential address, either by electricity account or proof of residence from the ward councillor, and their South African ID. Residents are advised to note that the hall can only accommodate 30 people. This was the only hall we could get for the meeting,” said Rorrick. She urged residents attending to bring their own black pen and advised them to wear a mask as all Covid-19 protocols will be adhered to.
