The person’s death must be reported to the Master’s Office located in the jurisdiction that the deceased lived in within 14 days. The winding up of an estate can be simple or complex, depending on the size of the estate.  If the deceased estate is smaller than R250 000, the process is relatively simpler and it is not necessary for an executor to be appointed. In this case, the Master of the High Court may issue a letter of authority to a nominated individual in terms of section 18 (3) of the Administration of Estates Act. The letter of authority permits the nominated individual to wind up the estate without following the full procedure in terms of the Administration of Estates Act. The nominated individual will distribute the assets of the deceased to his or her heirs and will pay and collect debts. If the value of the estate exceeds R250 000, it is necessary for an executor to be appointed and the full process prescribed by the Administration of Estates Act must be followed. A nominated executor will need to be issued with a Letter of Executorship by the Master of the High Court. Once a letter of executorship is issued, the Executor will: The liquidation and distribution account must be lodged at the Master’s Office. Once approved, it will be advertised and lie open for inspection for a period of 21 days. Any objections to the account must be lodged within the 21-day period. If there are no objections the Master will confirm that the executor may pay creditors and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. Once all creditors have been paid and all assets have been distributed the Master will confirm that the estate has been closed.
