With the flag-hoisting at the Shree Siva Subrahmanyar Temple on 8 January, devotees embarked on the start of the Thai Poosam Kavady Festival. Devotees ended the celebrations by carrying their Kavady from Agra Field to the Shree Siva Subrahmanyar Temple on Tuesday, 18 January. The field was filled with colour and devotees offered praise at the festive celebration. Many devotees told The Ladysmith Herald that it’s been challenging not to host such events due to the strict regulations, but with the lifting of many levels, devotees can now enjoy public celebrations with friends and family.  “I carry my Kavady for my family and believe that this year will be filled with blessings,” said a devotee. Other devotees gained spiritual trances and shared their spiritual trance by blessing those around them.
