A 52-year-old taxi boss was executed in a hail of bullets in full view of his family at their Cornubia residence on Saturday afternoon. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were called out to the housing complex at about 4.30pm. “On arrival, it was established that the deceased was in a bedroom with his partner and two sons on the upper level of the home. Two men entered the residence and shot the taxi boss multiple times in the presence of his family before they fled the scene. Several 9mm spent cartridges were recovered. The motive for the murder has not been confirmed at this stage,” said RUSA head, Prem Balram. Police are investigating.
