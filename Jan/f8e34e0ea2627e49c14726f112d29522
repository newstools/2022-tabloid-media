The act prohibits the publication and use of personal information as a means to protect people from harm by protecting their personal information. It prevents their identity being stolen and offers general protection for their privacy, which is a fundamental human right. The department this morning, on 11 January, said that in fear of violating this act, they will not be printing the Class of 2021 results as they have done in previous years. Elijah Mhlanga, department spokesperson, said that the DBE recognises that Section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, provides that everyone has the right to privacy. “This right to privacy includes a right to protection against the unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information. In order to comply with the provisions of the POPI Act, the usual practice of publishing the national senior certificate (NSC) results on public platforms (media platforms) will not occur for 2021. As was also the practice in previous years, all learners will be required to obtain their statement of results from the schools they attended. In this way, every learner’s personal information with regards to the outcome of their national senior certificate exam will be protected,” Mhlanga said. Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, also confirmed that schools are set to re-open from Wednesday, 12 January. She said government is ready to receive millions of learners for the 2022 academic year, as learners across the country will report for the start of the new school year between 12 and 17 January. Learners in inland provinces are expected to return to school on Wednesday, while schools in coastal areas will only resume a week later. “We call on families to assist learners by providing support systems. It is essential that we encourage learners and instil in them the importance of education. Covid-19 is still with us. Vaccination remains our best defence and we urge all learners aged 12 and older to vaccinate as soon as possible. Wearing of masks remains mandatory and all learners, teachers and other school staff must continue to do so. Together, we can make our schools safer for all,” the GCIS said.
