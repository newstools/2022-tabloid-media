Prayer moves the hand of God and he is mighty to save and is able to deliver our community from all evil. Please I beg you, come and join us on Saturday as we call on God to heal, save and deliver Sydenham from the hands of the enemy. If people can also speak to all their pastors and priests and other religious leaders in the area and ask them if they can please get involved and join us that would be wonderful.” Residents have planned a prayer meeting to be held at Sydenham Heights, A Block, on Saturday at 12pm.
