Westville-based humanitarian organisation, Tiny Steps Care team, in partnership with Motor Industry South Africa MISA, donated and delivered rape kits to the Phoenix Police Station  recently.  Tiny Steps founder, Naadia Sheik-Hameed, said the partnership between Tiny Steps and MISA was formed after research was done about the victim centre at the police station. “The initiative was also a vision of former police officer, Prema Naicker, who contacted us for assistance after she realised that the station was in desperate need of the kits. Police welcome victims who arrive on a daily and in between recording statements have to try to restore the dignities of the victims. Dorah Maduka of MISA was very helpful with the donation of the kits,” said Sheik-Hameed. She said it was an honour working with MISA in this initiative and she hopes that it will be continuous partnership. “Thank you to Sergeant Anneline Van Staden and Sergeant Naidoo, who work at the Phoenix Police Station, for all the work that they do; serving the community. We were so glad to make their task easier,” she said.
