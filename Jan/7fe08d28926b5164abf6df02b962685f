KRR: When I was little, I used to accompany my dad to his photographic studio and darkroom to watch and ‘help’ him develop his photos. That is where my love for photography began. I have always been creative and curious about capturing magical images. I got more serious about photography in 1999 while at university and doing part-time photo shoots. My enthusiasm for photography grew much more after the birth of my little girl in 2010, who I think was the most photographed baby in the entire world. Photography allows me to freeze priceless moments, which we can remember and treasure forever. CT: Tell us about being featured in two international magazines in the upcoming weeks. KRR: I recently received confirmation that I am the only photographer from not only South Africa but the whole of Africa to be selected by one of the most recognised newborn photographers in the world, Ana Brandt. My work is going to be showcased around the world in two high-quality International Publications that will both be published shortly. I have been placed amongst some of the best photographers and my photo is going to be published in an exclusive limited edition holiday magazine. This image was also selected to be featured in another international publication, the Brand Model Magazine. CT: Tell us more about the submission that landed you this achievement. KRR: I love challenges and within minutes of seeing the Magazine Image Call, I knew that I had to submit my image. My dream has always been to excel in the photographic and design field in order to have my work appreciated by not only South Africans but by people throughout the world. We were only allowed three submissions, so I knew that I had to make sure that my three images were meticulous in order to even be considered for selection. The image that was selected was also the only image I submitted of my baby boy, and it getting selected made it so much more special! CT: What does this achievement mean to you? KRR: Being the only photographer selected from the whole of Africa really makes it feel so surreal. I am so proud of this great achievement and I still cannot believe that my work is going to be showcased around the world. The selection process was extremely tough as I was not only competing with other professional photographers but also with other award-winning photographers from around the globe who were also submitting their very best images, in hopes of being selected. This achievement has resulted in me attaining tremendous global recognition, which is an acknowledgment that my work is of an international standard. CT: Who has been your greatest support in your journey thus far? KRR: My family, especially my daughter, has been the greatest support in my journey thus far. My little girl follows closely in my footsteps with her love and passion for photography. She is just as obsessed with photography as I am, and will not turn down an opportunity to capture something. She is my inspiration every day! My husband who is also my best friend and biggest fan has been of great support from the start of my photographic journey. He happily supports all my crazy ideas and he is always by my side. He even encourages my serious newborn prop addiction by helping to look for new and unique props that we can put the little newborns in. CT: What are some of the challenges that South African photographers face when promoting their work? KRR: Crime is a big challenge that many South African photographers face while out in the field. Another challenge South African photographers face is that photography is a very competitive market. Professional cameras are now much more affordable and many people are even opting for smartphone images instead of professional images due to the improved cameras on these devices. Due to the competitive market, getting recognition is not easy. CT: As a female photographer, what are some of the highlights you face and what are some of the challenges of your job? KRR: I am a ‘people person’ so the highlight of my job is definitely meeting new people every day. Specialising in newborns and babies makes my job so much better as I get to do what I love every single day! A major challenge that many female photographers face is the crime whilst out in the field. I have turned down many amazing job opportunities due to the risks involved whilst out on location shoots. CT: Can you remember the first image you ever took? KRR: The first image I took was when I was about four years old and I used my dad’s 35mm Single Lens Reflex Canon Camera. It was an image of my beautiful mom, who is still just as beautiful. CT: What are the three most important factors when taking a great photo? KRR: For me, the three most important factors when taking a great photo are light, subject, and composition. CT: What do you do when you have a creative mind block? KRR: When I have a creative mind block, I usually spend one-on-one time with my two precious little ones which helps me think clearly again. Sometimes, it is not that easy, as my little people are not always around me when a creative mind block decides to pop by, so during those times, I usually listen to music, dance (if no one is watching), or look over my gallery of images to help me focus again. CT: In your line of work, your name will always be remembered through your images. What legacy do you hope to leave? KRR: I hope to leave a legacy where I am remembered as one of the leading photographers not only in our country, South Africa, but in the world. I intend to continue reaching for the stars and attaining my goals so that one day I can be referred to as one of the world’s best photographers too! CT: What has been your most memorable shoot thus far? KRR: My most memorable shoot thus far has to be when I captured my 92-year-old gran last year. I captured so many tiny details, some of which I have not noticed before. She’s a phenomenal woman and we share an extremely close bond. CT: If not photography, what career would you have chosen? KRR: I would have specialised in graphic design and social media marketing. CT: Do you have any hidden talents? KRR: I have my Natal colours in karate and I am a pretty good chef as well. CT: What is your best piece of advice for aspiring photographers? KRR: Have patience and practise as much as possible in order to make your dreams a reality. Although photography can sometimes be very time-consuming, it is self-rewarding. Always do your best and never give up, because great things take time!
