Charnel Hattingh, the Head of Marketing and Communications at Fidelity ADT, said: “Employing staff to work on your property is not a decision to be taken lightly – for many reasons. The job description of a domestic helper can be immense, often involving the care of the elderly or children, housework and cooking.” Hattingh said that many parents who are working from home, due to Covid-19, still require additional help around the house to enable them to cope with their busy schedules. Choosing reliable and loyal domestic helpers is essential to safeguarding your home and family, whether you are home or not. “In today’s busy world, most households need a domestic worker, be it an au pair, babysitter, house help, caregiver or gardener. And, very often, the desperation to get someone hired overshadows the crucial need to conduct proper background checks on the prospective employees,” Hattingh said. She said the end result can be disastrous with you perhaps discovering you have a thief or kidnapper under your roof around vulnerable family members, especially children. “It is ignorant to neglect doing a background check on someone you want to hire to take care of your loved ones, pets and home.” Hattingh said that there is a growing concern regarding the number of home owners who employ helpers without conducting the necessary background checks and have live-in helpers who they know little to nothing about. Hattingh said this is alarming and is a contributing factor when it comes to home invasions and robberies. “It is also our experience that domestic helpers with criminal histories rely on the fact that many employers do not do proper checks. Ignoring screening of domestic workers leaves your family and home vulnerable,” she said. Domestic workers have a responsibility towards homeowners and their property and homeowners have a responsibility towards the safety of their workers while they are on the property. It is important to consider the factors that can make this type of relationship mutually beneficial for family and worker. Domestic staff are now eligible for workers’ compensation if they are injured on your property. This after the Constitutional Court ruled parts of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) as unconstitutional. According to the National Employers’ Labour Association (NELA), the amendment to the Act, yet to be promulgated, is retrospective, which means cases dating back to 2004 will be eligible for compensation. NELA’s Assistant General Secretary, Albert van der Merwe, reiterated that the definition of a “domestic worker” includes gardeners, nannies, caregivers and chauffeurs employed in private homes. “We all need to wake up and prioritise safety and security as a personal responsibility when it comes to domestic staff. This involves doing proper vetting before hiring and making sure your domestic helpers are safe while they carry out their duties and get the help they need in an emergency,” added Hattingh.
