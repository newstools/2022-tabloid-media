A manager in the office of the mayor is one of the suspended officials who is accused of allegedly unlawfully ordering a festive season roadblock to be scrapped which was put in place by Acting Municipal Manager Vish Govender. The manager is also accused of going against the instructions of Govender as the Acting City Manager and in doing so, poses a threat to the stability and safety of the municipality. Another senior official is accused of impersonating Govender during an executive meeting while the third one is accused of concealing that she once faced a disciplinary committee and went on to obtain a promotion by misleading the Executive Committee. Head of Communications of the Newcastle Municipality, Mlungisi Khumalo, said that the municipality has been made aware of the suspensions. “The Municipal Manager has been made aware of the suspensions of said employees. Unfortunately the municipality cannot dwell on the merits of suspension,” said Khumalo. He further stated that the municipality cannot discuss labour-related issues or suspensions as it is a sensitive matter between the employers and employees. “In such instances, the involved parties are given the space to deal with such issues internally. The media is usually informed when such matters are at a conclusive stage,” added Khumalo.
