Globally, malaria is one of the six major causes of death from a communicable disease and 90% of the world’s approximately 440 000 annual malaria fatalities occur in Africa. According to the NICD, people living in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal or Mpumalanga who have a fever or “flu-like” illness should get tested for malaria. This also applies to people who have travelled to Mozambique in the past six weeks. Sinenhlanhla Jimoh, NCID spokesperson, said: “Despite South Africa entering its peak malaria season, many malaria cases are being misdiagnosed as Covid-19. Both malaria and Covid-19 have similar, non-specific early symptoms including fever, chills, headaches, fatigue and muscle pain.” Jimoh said the tests that can be done include a rapid diagnostic test or a blood smear microscopy and if found positive, patients can immediately start with malaria treatment “In the event that someone is left undiagnosed and untreated, the disease will progress to severe illness with a potentially fatal outcome,” Jimoh said.
