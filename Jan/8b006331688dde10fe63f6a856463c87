A 57-year-old government hospital employee was arrested after being found in possession of stolen medical supplies in Phoenix on Wednesday, 19 January. Spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), Prem Balram, said: “Reaction officers on patrol noticed a red VW Polo and a white Ford Ranger bakkie with Department of Health branding parked alongside each other. The branded bakkie sped off upon noticing approaching reaction officers while the driver of the VW Polo attempted to load boxes into his boot. Officers stopped to investigate and recovered several boxes containing 8 000 gloves in the boot of the VW Polo.” Balram said during an interview with the suspect, it was established that he was employed as a driver for a government hospital. “It was the suspect’s day off and while at his residence he received a call from a work colleague who informed him that he had stolen the gloves from a Provincial Storage Centre on Lenham Drive in Phoenix. The suspect then agreed to meet his colleague to collect the stolen goods when they were intercepted. Reaction officers contacted the hospital’s management who arrived at the scene within minutes. They confirmed that the stolen boxes of gloves belonged to the government hospital. The suspect was placed under arrest and is currently detained at the Phoenix SAPS,” said Balram. Phoenix communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, confirmed the incident and said the 57-year-old man was arrested and charged on 19 January.
