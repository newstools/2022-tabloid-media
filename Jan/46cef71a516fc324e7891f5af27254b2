The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) would like to notify all learners, out of school youth, and non-funded students, that after consulting with various stakeholders, the deadline for applications for the student financial aid has been extended to Friday, 21 January 21. The application process opened on 2 November 2021 and to date, more than 600 000 applications were received from applicants who intend to further their post-school education at any of the 50 TVET colleges and 26 public universities. At least 505 820 are first-time applicants. NSFAS Chairperson, Ernest Khosa, briefed the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Dr Blade Nzimande, on the assessment done on the number of applications received to date. In this application cycle, NSFAS enhanced its application portal such that first-time applicants who are SASSA beneficiaries will receive a real-time response after submitting their application. To date, 182 567 applicants were confirmed eligible for funding instantly. The second cohort is non-SASSA applicants who will receive their responses once their income verification has been concluded. Potential applicants are urged to make use of the opportunity as there will be no further extension on the application deadline. Prospective students are urged to apply for admission at a public university or TVET college of their choice, for an approved course/programme.
