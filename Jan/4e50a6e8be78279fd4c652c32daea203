Inkosi Khumalo takes over from his mother, Inkosi Thandekile Ruth Khumalo, who succumbed to a short illness in August last year. The ceremony was attended by KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Sipho Hlomuka, who was accompanied by the Mayor of the uThukela District, Councillor Ntandoyenkosi Shabalala, and amakhosi from the surrounding communities. During the ceremony, Inkosi Khumalo vowed to work together with all the spheres of government to ensure that development takes place within his community. “As Inkosi, I am humbled by the responsibility that God has given me to lead his people. I have a first-hand account of the challenges that face us as a community and it is my desire to work with our community and all spheres of government to address challenges, such as the high youth unemployment within our area and gender-based violence, and to bring investment and improved service delivery to our people,” said Inkosi Khumalo. Speaking during the ceremony, MEC Hlomuka commended the royal family of abantungwa-kholwa for prioritising stability by ensuring that the seat of ubukhosi is not left vacant for too long. MEC Hlomuka also called upon the community to support their young Inkosi in the task that he has been given of leading isizwe. MEC Hlomuka then called upon the community to be the first line of defence against anyone who would try to harm their inkosi or any of his izinduna. “As a province, we are facing unprecedented attacks on the institution of traditional leadership. We have had cases where amakhosi and izinduna are murdered by unknown assailants. While the government is doing everything possible to arrest the perpetrators and bring an end to these killings, communities themselves can play an active role by coming forward with information that could assist the law enforcement agencies,” said MEC Hlomuka.
