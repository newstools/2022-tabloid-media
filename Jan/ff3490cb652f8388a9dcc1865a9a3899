Swift response by Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) resulted in the arrest of a 42-year-old suspect, in Phoenix, who strangled, stabbed and assaulted an elderly woman during a house robbery on 5 January. Prem Balram, RUSA spokesperson, said: “The RUSA Operations Centre received a call for assistance on Wednesday morning after the 62-year-old victim sought assistance from neighbours on Riverview Road. Reaction officers were dispatched to the property and on arrival found the woman bleeding from stab wounds to her hand,” said Balram. He said that a blood-soaked piece of material was found tied around the victim’s neck and she suffered blunt force trauma to her eyes due to being punched in the face. “The victim told reaction officers that she was watering her plants and as she entered the house, the suspect walked in behind her and began assaulting her. He grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her before he attempted to strangle her. He then stole her cellphone and fled on foot,” said Balram. He said the suspect was known to the woman and had previously visited her and asked for handouts. Residents in the Ottawa and Parkgate areas confirmed that the suspect was known in the area. “RUSA members received information that a man matching the description was spotted between Zwelisha and Phoenix. The suspect was located hiding on the upper level of a building. His pants were soiled with blood. During an interview, the suspect stated that he had sold the cellphone for R100 to a taxi driver shortly after the robbery. He then proceeded to Phoenix where he purchased heroin,” said Balram.
