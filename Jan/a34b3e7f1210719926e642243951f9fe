A Wentworth murder accused was successfully convicted and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for the fatal drive-by shooting of a 62-year-old victim on Jonas Road in Jacobs, in 2019. Communications officer at Wentworth SAPS, Captain M P Gumede, said that investigating officer, Detective B M Zulu, was praised for his efforts to secure a conviction with his meticulous investigation of the case. He said the shooting incident occurred on 17 February 2019. “The victim, 62, was standing outside the flats when gunshots went off towards the direction where he was. The victim ran but was shot on his body and he fell down. On the same day, the victim was rushed to hospital in Wentworth and he knew who had fired the shots. Due to the seriousness of the injuries, the victim was transferred to King Edward Hospital for further treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on 18 February 2019,” Capt Gumede said. On 25 February 2019, the 18-year-old accused, Lynden Patrick Jones, was arrested by the detectives at the corner of Woodville Road in Wentworth and was detained for murder. “Det Zulu was assigned the case and through sterling investigations and court appearances, bail was opposed. Jones was convicted for murder and handed down his sentence,” said Capt Gumede. “The investigating officer, Sgt Bhekinkosi Manqoba Zulu, is commended for ensuring that the accused was brought to book and charged. Station management applauds the officer on a job well done,” Capt Gumede added.
