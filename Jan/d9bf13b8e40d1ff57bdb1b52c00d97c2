Al-Imdaad Foundation assisted in uThukela District and beyond following the aftermath of heavy rains and flooding. Al-Imdaad teams have continued their assistance for affected communities in various areas of the uThukela District. Water deliveries have also reached communities in Ladysmith and the Mooi River area, which have recently faced water supply shortages. Al-Imdaad Foundation teams have had a busy few weeks. After their initial response to the Ladysmith floods they have continued to reach out to affected communities. Food hamper distributions have taken place in affected rural areas of the uThukela District including Tsakane in the Alfred Duma Municipality and Dukuza, Sandlwana, Bhetany, Hambrook, and Khetani in the Okhahlama Municipality.  The foundation received support for food hamper deliveries from sponsors such as Polokwane Muslim Welfare Foundation and the Caring Sisters’ Network. Hot meals have also been provided to families in the lower Ladysmith CBD who were affected by the recent floods. Additionally, water tanker services and 5L bottled water distributions have been helping to provide fresh supplies to families affected by supply disruptions.  Recent deliveries took place in Acaciavale and Smartiesville in Ladysmith and earlier on in Mooi River, where the community had been without water for three days. Al-Imdaad Foundation’s efforts continue in partnership with local authorities, NGO partners and sponsors. Head of the Department for South African Projects, Abed Karrim, said: “In working together there is no limit to what we can all achieve in striving to serve humanity.”
