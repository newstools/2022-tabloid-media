The National and Provincial Department of Basic Education spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, has said in a media statement that the 2021 National Senior Certificate (NSC) results will not be published on any public platforms. Historically, matriculants around the country would eagerly anticipate the release of their NSC results on public platforms but due to the new Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), no results or identities of learners will be made public. <img class="alignleft wp-image-68112 " src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_203,h_203/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="203" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_400/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-400x400.jpg 400w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_150/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_600/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-600x600.jpg 600w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_696/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-696x696.jpg 696w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1392/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-1392x1392.jpg 1392w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1068/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-1068x1068.jpg 1068w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_420/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-420x420.jpg 420w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_840/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2-840x840.jpg 840w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1500/https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Senior-Certificate-Pic2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /> The Act which came into effect in July 2021 serves to protect the personal information of all learners and the publishing of the results will be in direct contravention of the Act. Mhlanga said that in order to comply with the provisions of the Act, the conventional practice of making the NSC results public will not occur this year. In his statement, Mhlanga said the Department recognises the section in the Constitution that provides that everyone has the right to privacy. “This right to privacy includes a right to protection against the unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information,” he said. Mhlanga said that all learners who sat for the 2021 NSC examinations will be required to obtain their statement of results from their respective schools.  “In this way their personal information with regards to the outcome of their NCS examination will be protected,” he added. The NCS results for learners who attended public schools are expected to be announced on 20 January by Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga. Individual results will be made available online at schools on the 21 January.
