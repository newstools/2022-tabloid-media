A six-year-old child and his 51-year-old grandmother were sprayed with teargas by fleeing suspects at the entrance of their home in Brindhaven, Verulam, on Sunday 10 April. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) received calls from residents in the area witnessing the incident. RUSA Spokesperson Prem Balram said: “Upon arrival at the home on Glenhaven Drive, Reaction Officers were informed that the resident, his wife and grandchild had drove onto the driveway and found the main gate open.” He said the grandfather walked towards the home to investigate and that is when he noticed a lone suspect running towards him. “He attempted to defended himself with a outdoor chair when he noticed two other suspect’s approaching. One of the suspects sprayed teargas on the child and grandmother when they got off the vehicle to check on the elderly man.” Balram said the suspects had gained forced entry to the home via a sliding door and broke the locks on a burglar guard gate. “Jewels, an undisclosed amount of cash and other valuables were taken. The child suffered an allergic reaction to the pepper spray and was attended to by paramedics.”
