Muslims around the world will be scanning the skies this weekend for the sighting of the new moon which will signal the start of the new month on the Islamic Calendar, Shawwal, bringing an end to the month-long fast of Ramadaan. The first day of Shawwal is the day of Eid and is known as Eid-ul-Fitr.
