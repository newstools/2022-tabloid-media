Durban artists who are part of Favordot Intl, a South Beach non-profit organisation made up of teenagers, will be showcasing a collection of their work in two and three dimension exhibitions at the Gallery @Lifestyle Centre in Ballito this weekend. The teens make ottomans from recycled tyres to pay for education and supplement their families’ incomes. Jane Digby, artist co-ordinator and curator, said the exhibition is themed ‘Untethered’ and features a collaboration of some of the most exciting emerging artists working out of KZN. “This exhibition will entertain, intrigue, entice and create conversations and inspiration,” said Digby. Some of the other artists who will be featured include Zinhle, a businesswoman and stylist of My Basket Shop who will be exhibiting her baskets; Sarak Richards, a bronze sculptor; Phumlani Nwayo, a ceramicist and Peter Wink, a wood carver, just to name a few in the three dimension category. “In the two dimension category we will have, Nikhil Tricam, one of Durban’s most prolific and awarded artists and architects, Bron Stofberg of inkysensations, Janine Jollands, Guilia Forman, Kim Periera, Ann Schwanhart, Jane Oliver and more,” said Digby.
