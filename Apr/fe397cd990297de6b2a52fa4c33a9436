Communications Officer at Berea SAPS, Captain PN Naidoo, said: “On Monday, a foetus was found by a bin-picker opposite Musgrave Centre on Musgrave Road in Essenwood. The police were called and a docket was opened for concealment of birth. No arrests have been made. Investigations are ongoing.” A report of the gruesome discovery was shared on Facebook and social media users were divided about the deed. “How could anyone do that to their baby? She could have left the baby at a baby home or hospital, but instead opted to LITERALLY throw her baby away. It’s heart breaking!” stated one comment. (sic) Another Facebook comment read: “There is a baby safe at the hop shop in Davenport Road where you can deposit your unwanted baby with no questions asked.” (sic) “…no one knows the mother’s circumstances, perhaps very young, illiterate, raped who knows. Who are we to judge her?” a Facebook user shared. (sic) “For all we know the baby died at birth and the poor lady didn’t have any funds or knowledge of what to do. Very sad outcome at the end of the day,” a comment read.
