It was a weird and wonderful welcome into the world for a newborn baby girl whose mom gave birth to her on the pavement in central Durban with the assistance of Durban Metro Police officers on Monday afternoon.  Speaking to The Springfield Weekly Gazette, Metro Police Senior Superintendent, Parboo Sewpersad, said the Metro Police Control Centre received a complaint of a lady in distress in the Durban CBD. “Metro Police officers on foot patrol in the city centre alerted the Metro Control Room about the incident unfolding. Officers from the Metro Police Search and Rescue responded immediately and found the woman in a deep state of distress on the pavement. The Metro Search and Rescue officers assisted the woman and helped her to deliver a baby girl. The baby was assessed and found to be healthy. Mother and baby were transported to hospital for further medical care,” said Supt Sewpersd. Medi Response Spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said Medi Response paramedics responded to Durban central following reports of a childbirth in progress. “On arrival of crews, a young lady, who had just given birth to a healthy baby girl, was located on the sidewalk. Search and Rescue members reported that they had come across the lady who had collapsed and they assisted her with the delivery,” said Herbst. Supt Sewpersad added: “When a call for assistance is made, the response time for the victims or patients is critical. We urge callers to provide as much information as possible as this can be the crucial information between losing a life and saving a life. Well done to the Metro officers on the swift response and efficient assistance rendered on scene.”
