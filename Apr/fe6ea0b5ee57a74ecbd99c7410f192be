A little nine-year-old girl from Madadeni is on her way to one day gracing the catwalks of the world. Okuhlekwethu Dlamini has made herself and her family proud by walking away with the title of Miss Pre-Teen KwaZulu-Natal 2022. She took part in the Mr, Miss and Mrs KwaZulu-Natal and won in her category. The pageant, which was held in Empangeni at the Mfolozi Casino on 26 March, saw many young girls vying for the title. In addition to winning the title, Dlamini also bagged the awards for Best Junior Interview, Best Junior personality, Debutante Achievement and overall Miss Philanthropist. Dlamini said that her reason for entering the pageant was to build her self-confidence. “I would also like to use my title to give back to the community because this pageant is all about charity work and organisations which help the vulnerable,” said Dlamini. She added that she would love to become a doctor and a businesswoman one day. “I am a mini-Miss RSA Finalist which will be taking place in September and I would one day want to walk away with the Title of Miss South Africa,” she said.
