Concerned residents and businesses flocked to the shores of uMhlanga Rocks  beach recently, to lend a helping hand in cleaning up the coastline after devastating floods and torrential rainfall caused debris and waste material to be washed ashore. The clean-up, co-ordinated by the uMhlanga UIP, commenced following the severe flooding which took place in KwaZulu-Natal, last week. The uMhlanga UIP Precinct Manager, Dewet Geldenhuys, said it was incredibly encouraging to see the eThekwini Municipality also deploying manpower and vehicles in the clean-up effort. The UIP supplied two 13 cubic metre skips, 50 large canvas bags, 22 additional staff and tree felling teams for the project. “We extend a heartfelt thank you to the greater community and businesses for their help. Collectively we have made good progress and we won’t stop until the beaches are clean. Just a reminder to the public that high tides will continue to deposit rubbish and debris onto the beaches for the foreseeable future and we will work to address this,” said Geldenhuys.
