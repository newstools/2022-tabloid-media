A town submerged in municipal woes . The central business district of Ladysmith suffered a third blow of localised flooding when recent torrential rains wreaked havoc, resulting in SAPS and Public Safety officials working tirelessly to close off roads leading to lower parts of the CBD. Lyell Street, which forms part of the N11, was closed off and all traffic was diverted through Murchison Street with taxis having to find parking along streets in and around the town due to taxi ranks being flooded with knee-deep water.  The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have called on Premier Sihle Zikalala and his CoGTA MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, to immediately commence with the process of having the province declared a state of disaster after inclement weather conditions  caused havoc across the KZN province on Monday, 11 April. “This is the third time that I have tao clear my local shop,” said one of the business owners along Queen Street. He added that the continuous flooding of the area is increasingly bad for local businesses. Martin Meyer, MPL for the DA, said that the municipality’s failure to keep stormwater drains cleared, maintain roads or even ensure proper street-lighting to help drivers in these difficult conditions, is a contributing factor which resulted in such extensive damages. “The tragedy is that, had these areas been prioritised, much of the damage we are seeing may have been minimised. Instead, years of neglect and incompetence are threatening the property and lives of our citizens,” said Meyer.He added that the DA will also be calling on the MEC to conduct a full audit on the level of basic service delivery within municipalities and to take real action. “As the world experiences climate change, these types of extreme weather conditions will become the norm. KZN’s provincial government needs to show that it is a caring government by becoming more pro-active in preparing for such disasters.”
