The Durban branch  of Diabetes  South Africa,  a non-profit  and public benefit organisation that empowers all those affected by type one and two of the illness, is appealing for support with their latest fundraiser. Branch Manager, Sean Gunn, said over the past two years, funding for the organisation has drastically dwindled which has had a huge impact on the services of Diabetes South Africa – Durban. He said: “With this in mind, as part of our fundraising endeavour we are offering a Mother’s Day hamper to those who wish to purchase one for the price of R500 each. The hamper, which would make a splendid gift is filled to the brim with treats such as soaps, body lotions and a handy toiletry bag.” Gunn said the purpose of selling these hampers is to raise funds for DSA, which will assist the NGO to provide educational literature to various learners in impoverished areas, concerning the prevention and treatment of diabetes. “The funds raised will also be used to improve the lives of those who rely heavily on our support groups. The funds are also used to purchase testing strips and glucometers and to stock various medical supplies for our in house nurse,” he added. Diabetes South Africa – Durban has been serving the community since 1969 and has joined forces with various other societies such as the Society for Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa, Diabetes Education Society of South Africa and Centres for Diabetes and Endocrinology, in order to bolster its efforts to combat this disease which continues to claim lives, cause loss of limbs and vision due to late detection or improper medical management. Through their tireless efforts they create awareness by highlighting the risk factors associated with diabetes by promoting healthy lifestyles and early detection.
