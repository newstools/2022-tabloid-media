Durban-based non-profit-organisation, Green Corridors, which cares for green spaces around the City, has been awarded with a Certificate of Appreciation by Plastics SA for its commitment and dedication to helping restore rivers and for protecting our waterways and natural environment.  The environmental organisation is committed to sustainable use and protection of environment as they are also in charge of the bookings for the local hikes in Molweni community, aimed at protecting green spaces and community upliftment. The Caroline Reid Award was presented to Green Corridors’ Coastal and Waste Management Projects Officer, Musawenkosi Shange, who works with the NPO’s Green Spaces programme, and Tri-ecotours founder and Green Corridors’ Litterboom Coordinator, Siphiwe Rakgabale. Caroline Reid was an ocean conservation warrior who coordinated hundreds of beach and diving clean-ups, was central in the work done with the loss of plastic pellets (nurdles) in the Durban Harbour in 2017 and with her networking skills, increased the awareness of plastic pollution on the KwaZulu-Natal Coastline. Green Corridors has a vision to provide solutions and support for cleaning of natural environments, ensuring waste is recycled, repurposed, or removed, and that communities within these areas are significantly involved.   Green Corridors’ Coastal and Waste Management Projects Officer, Musawenkosi Shange, said that they would like to thank Plastics SA for this recognition as they continue to carry on the legacy of Caroline Reid. “The work we do is very much in collaboration with a number of partner organisations and stakeholders including Adopt-a-River, WESSA, and Umgeni Estuary Conservancy, DUCT’s Amanzi Eyethu Nobuntu programme, the eThekwini Municipality’s Solid Waste and Parks Department, with support from sponsors such as SAPRIPOL and PETCO. Green Corridors Marketing, Duncan Pritchard said that, “Green Corridors has a vision to provide solutions and support for cleaning of natural environments, ensuring waste is recycled, repurposed, or removed, and that communities within these areas are significantly involved,” he said. Tri-Ecotours founder and Green Corridors’ Litterboom Coordinator, Siphiwe Rakgabele said that, “We hope that the work we do in restoring and cleaning river ways helps to create improved natural spaces for people to connect with nature, and the planet and improve their quality of life.”
