Freedom Day is a public holiday celebrated on 27 April  in South Africa. It celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post-apartheid elections held on that day in 1994. The elections were the first non-racial national elections where people of voting age of over 18 from any race group, including foreign citizens that permanently reside in South Africa were allowed to vote. As the country commemorates Freedom Day, a Croftdene interracial couple said they are excited to have had the freedom to love and marry each other post-apartheid. The two love-birds, Samantha Joelene Chislett with her husband, Rocky and their beautiful daughters, Kelly Maryann and Chloe said they  look forward to celebrating Freedom Day and their love story. Previously, under the apartheid regime, two people from different race groups were not allowed to form a matrimony. The couple has been married for six years. Samantha, 32 who has a home-based cupcake business said that she met her husband, Rocky, 30, a snake catcher on a dating site nine years ago. She said: “When I met my husband, he was from Cape Town. He later moved to Pietermaritzburg. We had a long distance friendship. Within a short period of time, we became best friends. We did not exchange pictures, but just spoke over the phone and chatted. After a while, he moved to Seaview in Durban. We decided to meet each other for the first time on my birthday. He surprised me with a sparkling gift, a birthday cake and took me for lunch. After dating for a year, we decided to tie the knot.” She added that although they are from two different backgrounds, they had full support from both their families. “We planned a beautiful wedding and now have two amazing daughters. The man of my dreams and my best friend became my life partner and I will not trade our relationship for anything,” she said.
