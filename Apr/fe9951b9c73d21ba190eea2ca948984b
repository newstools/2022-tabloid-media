What better site than Durban’s Botanic Gardens to open up this exploration of self to our natural world? In this moving dance work, the Botanic Gardens – also bearing the scars of a colonial heritage – is transformed into a site of continued natural beauty and potential transformations. According to Artistic Director, Dr Lliane Loots, this is a ritual for us humans, and for the Earth – a cultural enactment of the sacred bond between the dancers and the ground they move on as they ‘cleanse’ themselves; ready for a deeper connection to one another and to the Earth. “This is moving and powerful choreo-poetry which aims to subtly carry its audience to places of deep knowing and awareness,” said Dr Loots. Created in the evolving collaborative creative process, this site-responsive dance work is jointly created by Lliane Loots, Sifiso Khumalo, Jabu Siphika, Mthoko Mkhwanazi, Sbonga Ndlovu, Siseko Duba and Ndumiso Dube. ‘The Cleansing’ takes place at the Botanic Gardens from 20 to 24 April at 6pm each evening and the audience is welcome to bring their own picnic, glass of wine and a blanket to sit on. Doors open at 5.30pm and the show starts at 6pm.
