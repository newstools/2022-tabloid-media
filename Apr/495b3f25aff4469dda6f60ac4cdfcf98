She loved her family and her husband. Our child was her world. She was passionate about reading her bible and praying with her family. She was passionate about plants and people. Everyone would admire the plants that she grew. She was giving and whenever she heard of someone in need, her heart went out to them. She would go the extra mile to ensure she could assist. She had a heart of gold and compassion. We have been married for two and a half years. She dreamt big, worked hard, loved unconditionally and walked with humility. She will be missed dearly by everyone who knew her,” he said.  Ronica excelled at her work and had won the SANA (South African Nursery Association) awards several years in a row.
