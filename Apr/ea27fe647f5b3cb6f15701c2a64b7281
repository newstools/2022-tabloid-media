South Coast based poet, writer and author, Ekta Somera launched her second book titled, ‘Twenty-Two’. The launch event was held at the Coffee Lounge in Scottburgh on Saturday, 2 April.  The 22-year-old South African youth ambassador from Umkomaas is a writer of two poetry collections and the founder of Paper Trail Literary Journal. Somera said she considers her book as a tool of restoring hope and keeping dreams alive for the generation that has lost hope. “I wrote Twenty-Two for those who weren’t given the freedom to be themselves. We each have a pair of invisible wings and we can find them even through the cages we are forced to live in. I found mine and I hope that my readers will too. I hope that this book with the symbol of a butterfly will remind people that it is never too late to transform yourself, because who you are is far more important than what you appear to be” said Somera. One of Somera’s poetry collection focuses on a year in the life of the author, it depicts spiritual growth in a transition from a caterpillar to a butterfly with carefully articulated anecdotes and imagery of nature, love and healing. Somera said she is passionate about inspiring leadership into a ever changing world and also creating opportunities for youth development.
